i dont disagree with you in principle im just saying that entresto ha been a major failure of novartis commercial organisation they novartis were totally exposed at q call with reimbursement issue being resolved the true underlying problem with entresto wa unveiled novartis failed to create the demand for the drug their diseaseawareness campaign in the u the drowning man wa incredibly poor fear and panicinducing what is more they advertised the wrong condition they were raising awareness of lifethreatening acute heart failure instead of chronic heart failure for which entresto is indicated entresto ha nothing to do with the treatment of acute heart failure if that wa not due to their shocking lack of knowledge of the disease area it can only be explained a a conscious misleading of patient they managed to alienate medical community advocacy group and top kols including their own principal investigator in entresto trial who publicly expressed his concern it unheard of but it provides clue a to what actually happened an incompetent strategic marketing team establishes the wrong gotomarket model based on wrong market assumption and they persistently kept going in the wrong direction completely oblivious to the extent of their own incompetence it a typical example of ignorance bias ignorance more frequently begets confidence than doe knowledge if it wasnt for the analyst who were challenging novartis in public who know how long they would have continued to be in denial it is stunning that novartis once a leading cardiovascular company bombed the launch of a cardiovascular primary care product a combo of their own diovan with this they discovered a new low david wa let down by his own people he trusted them but he should have known better his handsoff management style didnt work at novartis pharma in contrast to oncology it a toxic culture populated with yes people where competence and skill are not valued or required for promotion it is strange though that after so many year in operational position joerg seemingly stayed uninvolved at least thats how it look from the outside jun http cafepharmacom board thread epstein post,0

there a discussion about recumbent power on brol the extract make a brief aside about the need to pee in the standing position the lung can be roughly divided into three zone where there is ventilation but no perfusion the top of the lung there is no blood flow because the pressure head out of the right heart is not high enough to pump blood that high where there is ventilation and perfusion the middle part of the lung and where there is perfusion but no ventilation the bottom of the lung where the fluid pressure is higher than the opening pressure of the bronchiole and alveolus where gas exchange take place all this is dependent on gravity and fluid pressuresbasic physic the volume of the air in the airway that doesnt participate in gas exchange combined with the volume of air in zone is called the dead space and amount to about of your normal breath when you assume a supine or recumbent position thing change zone get a lot smaller but zone get bigger and there is a large individual variation secondly the volume of blood that resides in the lower extremity when upright get pushed back into the system when you are supine and the pulmonary circulation since it is a high volumelow pressure system end up being the receptacle for much of it that is why people in heart failure like to sleep sitting upthey can breathe much better lung function is the same but respiratory function ha changed that is also one of the reason why people riding recumbents tend to have to pee more after riding for a whilestretch receptor in the vessel signal the fluid load to the body which in turn signal the kidney to make more urine apr http forumcyclingukorg viewtopicphpftp,0

blood pressure is a measurement of the pressure in your artery during the active and resting phase of each heartbeat here what the number mean systolic pressure the first top number in a blood pressure reading this is the amount of pressure your heart generates when pumping blood through your artery to the rest of your body diastolic pressure the second bottom number in a blood pressure reading this refers to the amount of pressure in your artery when your heart is at rest between beat current guideline identify normal blood pressure a lower than mm hg although you can get an accurate blood pressure reading at any given time blood pressure isnt always the same it can vary considerably in a short amount of time sometimes from one heartbeat to the next depending on body position breathing rhythm stress level physical condition medication you take what you eat and drink and even time of day blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rise sharply on waking blood pressure how low can you go whats considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else most doctor consider chronically low blood pressure too low only if it cause noticeable symptom some expert define low blood pressure a reading lower than mm hg systolic or mm hg diastolic you need to have only one number in the low range for your blood pressure to be considered lower than normal in other word if your systolic pressure is a perfect but your diastolic pressure is youre considered to have lower than normal pressure a sudden fall in blood pressure also can be dangerous a change of just mm hg a drop from systolic to mm hg systolic for example can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive an adequate supply of blood and big plunge especially those caused by uncontrolled bleeding severe infection or allergic reaction can be lifethreatening athlete and people who exercise regularly tend to have lower blood pressure and a slower heart rate than do people who arent a fit so in general do nonsmoker and people who eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight but in some rare instance low blood pressure can be a sign of serious even lifethreatening disorder condition that can cause low blood pressure some medical condition can cause low blood pressure these include pregnancy because a woman circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy blood pressure is likely to drop this is normal and blood pressure usually return to your prepregnancy level after youve given birth heart problem some heart condition that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate bradycardia heart valve problem heart attack and heart failurethese condition may cause low blood pressure because they prevent your body from being able to circulate enough blood endocrine problem thyroid condition such a parathyroid disease adrenal insufficiency addisons disease low blood sugar hypoglycemia and in some case diabetes can trigger low blood pressure dehydration when you become dehydrated your body loses more water than it take in even mild dehydration can cause weakness dizziness and fatigue fever vomiting severe diarrhea overuse of diuretic and strenuous exercise can all lead to dehydrationfar more serious is hypovolemic shock a lifethreatening complication of dehydration it occurs when low blood volume cause a sudden drop in blood pressure and a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching your tissue if untreated severe hypovolemic shock can cause death within a few minute or hour blood loss losing a lot of blood from a major injury or internal bleeding reduces the amount of blood in your body leading to a severe drop in blood pressure severe infection septicemia septicemia can happen when an infection in the body enters the bloodstream this condition can lead to a lifethreatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially lifethreatening allergic reaction common trigger of anaphylaxis include food certain medication insect venom and latex anaphylaxis can cause breathing problem hive itching a swollen throat and a drop in blood pressure lack of nutrient in your diet a lack of the vitamin b and folate can cause a condition in which your body doesnt produce enough red blood cell anemia causing low blood pressure medication that can cause low blood pressure some medication you may take can also cause low blood pressure including diuretic water pill such a furosemide lasix and hydrochlorothiazide microzide oretic alpha blocker such a prazosin minipress and labetalol beta blocker such a atenolol tenormin propranolol inderal innopran xl others and timolol drug for parkinson disease such a pramipexole mirapex or those containing levodopa certain type of antidepressant tricyclic antidepressant including doxepin silenor imipramine tofranil protriptyline vivactil and trimipramine surmontil sildenafil viagra or tadalafil cialis particularly in combination with the heart medication nitroglycerin type of low blood pressure doctor often break down low blood pressure hypotension into different category depending on the cause and other factor some type of low blood pressure include low blood pressure on standing up orthostatic or postural hypotension this is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or if you stand up after lying downordinarily gravity cause blood to pool in your leg whenever you stand your body compensates for this by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessel thereby ensuring that enough blood return to your brainbut in people with orthostatic hypotension this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure fall leading to symptom of dizziness lightheadedness blurred vision and even fainting orthostatic hypotension can occur for a variety of reason including dehydration prolonged bed rest pregnancy diabetes heart problem burn excessive heat large varicose vein and certain neurological disorder a number of medication also can cause orthostatic hypotension particularly drug used to treat high blood pressure diuretic beta blocker calcium channel blocker and angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitor a well a antidepressant and drug used to treat parkinson disease and erectile dysfunction orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adult with a many a percent of those older than age experiencing orthostatic hypotension but orthostatic hypotension can also affect young otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their leg crossed for long period or after working for a time in a squatting position low blood pressure after eating postprandial hypotension postprandial hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure after eating it affect mostly older adultsjust a gravity pull blood to your foot when you stand a large amount of blood flow to your digestive tract after you eatordinarily your body counteracts this by increasing your heart rate and constricting certain blood vessel to help maintain normal blood pressure but in some people these mechanism fail leading to dizziness faintness and fall postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorder such a parkinson disease lowering the dose of blood pressure drug and eating small lowcarbohydrate meal may help reduce symptom low blood pressure from faulty brain signal neurally mediated hypotension this disorder cause blood pressure to drop after standing for long period leading to sign and symptom such a dizziness nausea and faintingneurally mediated hypotension mostly affect young people and it seems to occur because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brainwhen you stand for extended period your blood pressure fall a blood pool in your leg normally your body then make adjustment to normalize your blood pressure but in people with neurally mediated hypotension nerve in the heart left ventricle actually signal the brain that blood pressure is too high rather than too low a a result the brain lessens the heart rate decreasing blood pressure even further this cause more blood to pool in the leg and le blood to reach the brain leading to lightheadedness and fainting low blood pressure due to nervous system damage multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension also called shydrager syndrome this rare disorder cause progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system which control involuntary function such a blood pressure heart rate breathing and digestionalthough this condition can be associated with muscle tremor slowed movement problem with coordination and speech and incontinence it main characteristic is severe orthostatic hypotension in combination with very high blood pressure when lying down low blood pressure cause general hypotension low blood pressure without symptom is not generally a cause for concern longterm hypotension that doe not cause symptom is rarely serious in fact many athlete have low blood pressure and have a decreased risk of developing heart disease hypotension that cause symptom may be a sign of an underlying health condition sometimes hypotension may even indicate a serious and or lifethreatening problem such a a widespread infection below are some of the most common cause of hypotension allergic reaction anaphylaxis a lifethreatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis often cause a sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure additional symptom may include itching hive difficulty breathing swelling of the throat and tongue stomach cramp nausea and diarrhea this reaction may occur in response to medication herb supplement food such a peanut bee sting or other severe allergy blood loss sudden hypotension may occur if a person loses a lot of blood from a serious injury internal bleeding or complication during surgery the severity of hypotension depends on how much blood is lost endocrine problem endocrine disorder also called hormonal disorder may cause hypotension endocrine problem occur when the body release too many or too few hormone which are chemical that help regulate bodily function endocrine problem such a an underactive thyroid called hypothyroidism overactive thyroid called hyperthyroidism adrenal insufficiency called addisons disease low blood sugar level and in some case diabetes may lead to hypotension dehydration dehydration may lead to hypotension even mild dehydration may cause symptom such a lightheadedness dizziness and weakness severe dehydration may lead to a lifethreatening complication called hypovolemic shock this condition occurs when a decreased blood volume in the body cause a sudden drop in blood pressure a a result the body tissue and organ do not receive enough oxygen if left untreated hypoyolemic shock may be fatal within a few minute to hour heart problem several heart problem including an extremely low heart rate called bradycardia heart valve problem heart attack and heart failure may lead to hypotension these condition prevent the body from circulating enough blood to tissue and organ medication many drug can cause low blood pressure including diuretic blood pressurelowering drug heart medication such a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker drug used to treat parkinson disease tricyclic antidepressant erectile dysfunction drug such a viagra narcotic and alcohol other medication prescription and overthecounter may lower blood pressure when they are taken in combination with blood pressurelowering drug nutritional deficiency people who have low level of vitamin b and folate may develop anemia a condition that may cause low blood pressure people who have eating disorder such a anorexia or bulimia have an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiency that can lead to hypotension pregnancy a woman blood pressure often decrease during pregnancy this is because the mother circulatory system expands quickly during pregnancy during the first week of pregnancy it is common for a woman systolic blood pressure to drop five to point and for her diastolic pressure to drop point septicemia and septic shock a severe infection called septicemia may lead to hypotension septicemia occurs when an infection enters the bloodstream and spread throughout the body a the heart work extra hard to pump blood throughout the body it start to weaken and blood pressure drop when blood pressure drop to dangerously low level the condition is called septic shock feb http quranfruitzblogspotcom causesoflowbloodpressurehypotensionhtml,0

worse manager ever l out of richmond ugh what a self centered i like to hear myself speak on conference call egotistical narcissistic bitch it is hard to believe she is a nurse doesnt have one single nursing quality after reading this article however the area manager are just a reflection of what come from the top down get a clue novartis karma will get you and it is already salivating at your ankle cloud gather over novartis a it battle series of setback andrew ward in london and ralph atkins in zurich joe jimenez is facing a battle to restore investor confidence in novartis after a series of setback which have sent share in the swiss pharmaceutical group down more than a quarter in the past year disappointing sale of a new heart drug have combined with problem in the group alcon eyecare business to create arguably the rockiest period for mr jimenez since the american took charge six year ago legal risk have added to the gloom a novartis face investigation for suspected marketing abuse in the u south korea and turkey on top of recent case in japan and china all these problem have been brewing for month but the heat ha turned up in the past few week a a succession of analyst cut growth forecast for the group mr jimenez still ha credit with investor for asweeping overhaul in which novartis ha narrowed the sprawling range of business built by his predecessor daniel vasella he is likely to trumpet progress towards cutting cost and restructuring alcon when the group announces firstquarter result on thursday however the headline number are unlikely to part the cloud hanging over novartis analyst expect sale and profit to be down a the eyecare business continues to drag on performance the mood wa much different a year ago when the group wa preparing to launch entresto a muchanticipated treatment for heart failure data showing that the drug cut death by a fifth in clinical trial fuelled confidence that it would be the new blockbuster novartis desperately needed to offset the looming loss of patent protection on it bestselling gleevec cancer drug yet instead of the expected gush sale of entresto started at a trickle the m registered in the final quarter of wa le than a tenth of analyst forecast they have described the launch a glacial and a huge disappointment novartis declined to comment citing the quiet period ahead of it result but analyst sympathetic to the group point out that mr jimenez wa always clear that it would take time for entresto to gain momentum there ha so far been no retreat from his longterm target for peak annual sale of bn from the drug others are no longer a confident citigroup last month slashed it entresto sale forecast from bn in to just bn the worry for investor is that entrestos weak start may be a harbinger of tougher time ahead in the u two muchhyped cholesterollowering drug from sanofi andamgen have also been stuck in the slow lane since their launch last year this ha added to evidence that u insurer and healthcare provider are becoming more aggressive in their bargaining with big pharma a structural change in the health system increase incentive for cost saving without a strong contribution from entresto this year novartis ha been left badly exposed to a decline at alcon a business acquired from nestl for bn in a twopart transaction completed in mr jimenez announced a change of leadershipat the unit in january and narrowed it focus to contact lens and surgical equipment while it eye drug were transferred to the main pharma division a target wa set for alcon to return to growth by the end of the year and mr jimenez insisted that eyecare remained an attractive market given rising demand from an ageing world population however seamus fernandez analyst at leerink say the business may be sold if the turnround falter further uncertainty come from the series of investigation facing novartis over suspected marketing abuse in the u turkey and south korea that is on top of a m settlement paid to the u security and exchange commission last month for bribery in china and a suspension of it business in japan last year a punishment for manipulating clinical trial data by far the biggest peril is from a lawsuit being pursued by preet bharara the formidable u attorneygeneral for the southern district of new york he ha accused novartis of funnelling kickback to prescribers through a many a sham educational meeting where doctor were wined and dined mr bharara ha already secured a m settlement from novartis in a separate case last year and andrew baum analyst at citigroup say there is a high probability of another fine that could be similar in scale to the record bn paid byglaxosmithkline to the u justice department in like gsk novartis might also have to commit to marketing reform that would make it harder to aggressively push entresto mr baum said this could severely impact earnings and cast a reputational shadow over the incumbent novartis chairman joerg reinhardt and ceo in an attempt to clean up novartis ha appointed a chief ethic officer and is in the process of tightening it rule on relation with doctor for all the challenge some analyst still see reason for optimism while entresto ha flopped so far another new product cosentyx for psoriasis ha started strongly with forecast of bn in annual sale by michael nawrath analyst at z�rcher kantonalbank say mr jimenez could refresh the business with bolton deal it doesnt have to be a mega merger but there are smart asset swap collaboration or purchaseswhich could convince shareholder

it been a big week here in the uk this week george osborne dropped the uk federal budget it got some interesting point and one headline and vote grabbing new measure if the uk budget is anything to go by and it is then the aussie budget in a couple of month time could be just a big whatever happens in the upcoming aussie budget my take is theyll follow suit with the uk most talked about new tax the sugar tax first thing first let quickly recap why the sugar tax is even a thing the world health organisation who regard childhood obesity a one of the most serious and significant global challenge of the st century their concern are just in the uk the national child measurement program ncmp measure the height and weight of around one million schoolkids every year their result were truly shocking approximately of child aged were obese around were overweight for kid aged were obese and overweight in the uk around one in three kid are obese or overweight the australian institute of health and welfare report that of australian child are obese or overweight they rate it a a higher burden of disease than smoking this is a problem everywhere who do you blame the food industry my view on the childhood obesity epidemic is pretty black and white and sometimes unpopular if you underfeed your kid it child abuse if you overfeed them it the same there no two way about it a parent you are responsible for the health and safety of your kid there no question that childhood obesity is a global problem long term it a significant issue for government welfare and healthcare system the university of maryland medical centre list the side effect of obesity type diabetes high blood pressure coronary artery disease high cholesterol high level of fat in the blood heart failure respiratory problem now imagine a whole generation of kid living with this in life it will result in death far earlier than necessary it will also result in incredible strain on healthcare system the independent report that in the uk the bill for obesityrelated illness reach bn a year the journal of occupational and environmental medicine highlight compared to nonsmoker average health cost were higher for smoker the incremental cost associated with obesity were even higher more than for normalweight individual for those with morbid obesity the excess cost were up to per year it all just a bad in australia the national health and medical research council state a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd predicts that there will be continued increase in overweight and obesity level across all age group during the next decade in australia to around of the population they go on to explain that data from the australian diabetes obesity and lifestyle ausdiab study indicate that the total direct cost for overweight and obesity in wa billion billion for overweight and billion for obesity the same study estimated indirect cost of billion per year resulting in an overall total annual cost of billion colagiuri et al the world is getting fat kid are getting fat parent are getting fat this fat epidemic is killing u and killing economy someone need to put a stop to it but who who do you blame who the scapegoat here wheres the easy out taking the easy route argument are this is an industry problem if food and beverage industry didnt pack so much sugar into food and drink the problem wouldnt be a bad this line of argument ha led the british government to a world first sugar tax the tax will come in from and any soft drink with more than five gram of sugar per ml is in trouble the bbc report that the office for budgetary responsibility suggests the levy will add p au or p au per litre or about p au or p au to a standard ml can that mean for a red bull pepsi or coke around p au per can will be added to the price this is a serious tax generation policy for the uk estimate are it will raise million au billion per year in extra revenue the aim is it will go towards promoting and developing sport in school if thats true well well see how it play out taxing parent doesnt win an election the uk ha set a bar that i believe other country around the world will now follow and i think that australia will be next the timing is perfect precedence ha been set all scott morrison need to do is just follow suit imagine if this roll out worldwide in red bull sold billion can of red bull do the math if every red bull had cent tax added it would raise billion and thats just red bull add it to coke pepsi mountain dew monster and rockstar it would mean billion around the world in tax revenue i think this sugar tax is all posturing it reek of political vote grabbing when you boil it down a sugar tax wont really reduce the occurrence of obesity but it will take a good decade or so to see that meanwhile it will raise billion for the government while making what look like a socially responsible move britvic plc lonbvic a drink maker plunged from to within hour of the announcement ag barr plc lonbag who make the popular irnbru is down over since wednesday sure soft drink are high in sugar but so is chocolate chip white bread pasta sauce tomato sauce cake fruit juice and a whole range of other food that are just a bad for kid the buck really stop with parent the best and only way to tackle childhood obesity is through parent you want to tax something to tackle obesity increase the income tax on parent with obese kid see how well that go down with voter the sugar tax in the uk will stay it will continue to

a little more than a year ago my colleague and i started the streetcred police killing in context data project there were already several project tracking police shooting including fatal encounter and new project at the washington post and the guardian but we felt that they left out crucial context why did the police become involved in these incident in the first place wa their use of force something that most people would consider reasonable such a the police response after mohammad youssef abdulazeez opened fire on military personnel at a chattanooga tenn recruiting station or wa it unreasonable a with the shameful killing of walter scott the most common criticism i received wa that it wa an attempt to demonstrate that police arent the problem im a white texas cop so thats not an unreasonable presumption but i hope youll see that what we found can steer the conversation toward more productive and meaningful reform we began a others did with the fatal encounter database where the post pulitzer prizewinning effort focused on police shooting we focused on all policerelated death and where the guardian included killing by for example prison guard or traffic accident or personal dispute between officer we focused only on official act on or offduty by police officer ultimately we gathered more than contextual data point from the mundane middle name to the specific if the person wa listed a mentally ill wa it a previously diagnosed serious mental illness or merely suspected we eventually identified case in which unarmed civilian had died after an encounter with police in we now had a wealth of contextual data that we believed could add a lot to the ongoing dialogue about police shooting we think the context for these shooting transcends both race and politics we have assembled our finding in a book in context understanding police killing of unarmed civilian which we believe is instructive for activist police officer and useofforce trainer the context behind these shooting can also help reader understand how police and trainer approach these case and the applicable law they use to determine when different level of force are justified we tried to be objective but true objectivity is of course impossible everyone ha inherent bias instead weve tried to be a open and transparent a we can we included more than sourcefootnotes in the book a well a an open update system to track when we got something wrong the data methodology and schema on which we based our conclusion are all open and available under the creative common share alike license so please feel free to check our work from my interpretation of the data there are some relatively easy change police and policymakers can make that will go a long way toward improving policing in the united state here are what you might call the lowhanging fruit police must release more data and do it sooner when agency delay public suspicion and speculation fill the void every time police choose transparency it a deposit in the bank of goodwill it build community trust la vega ha shown that a police department can be transparent and forthcoming after a police shooting without disrupting the integrity of the investigation honesty begin with a timely release of the earliest available information that might include a timeline recording of call a narrative and any video without video or call the public ha nothing but the word of the police and a we have seen police do sometimes lie not always not even a lot according to our research but consider the walter scott shooting and the apparent lie told by officer michael slager a highprofile case like that can quickly make citizen lose faith in the system sunlight is the best disinfectant while the medium and activist group often focus on race the data show a greater disparity in deadly engagement with drug addict and the mentally ill in nearly half percent of the death of unarmed civilian after a police encounter involved someone suffering from serious mental illness overdosing on drug or both we tend to think of both mental health and drug addiction to be issue at the margin of society these issue need far more social legal and policy attention than theyre getting one approach gaining popularity is the memphis model crisis intervention team cit for first responder under the cit model police officer are trained how to recognize the symptom of a mental illness crisis how to communicate with people experiencing a mental health crisis and how to intervene without escalating the model ha been widely praised and should continue to be adopted around the country but it is clear that the problem is bigger than just crisis management the work need to start before a mentally ill person go into crisis in the first place were also seeing new program to address that problem with promising result a program in the midcities between dallas and fort worth for example ha been successful in training cop on new way to liaise with the mentally ill by focusing on wellness check in addition to crisis management the area ha seen a reduction in acute mental health crisis hospitalization such creative program stress regular visit and include outreach to friend and family it a really smart way to work it save life and money and arguably make the community more strongly supportive of all it resident many state police academy have also been adding more training in mental health and disability in my opinion we need more of these program and with an even broader focus but even with new training we must remember that the police should be the last line of defense from mentally ill people who potentially pose a threat to the community instead police are too often the first the federal government ha long passed the buck on mental health to the state under both democratic and republican administration state government have also dropped the ball mental illness is a societywide issue it cant just be a police issue the buck can be passed down but cop cant pa the buck back up and if we are going to insist on asking cop to respond to mentalhealth crisis the least we can do is give them the proper training and support look at all disability not just mental illness when we add physical disability such a pulmonary emphysema enlarged heart hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease thyroid disorder to that statistic the number of unarmed citizen who died after a police encounter suffering from drug mental illness and or physical disability is percent that of course is more than half we need to consider a a society the effect our national healthcare policy can have on policing we also need to be make sure police are properly trained to interact with people with disability such a deafness or autism health care and policing arent unrelated issue cop alone cant change this it should be part of the larger conversation among activist healthcare professional journalist and law enforcement leader while it true that fixing the american healthcare system isnt exactly lowhanging fruit one fix that would go a long way is better coordination among police healthcare provider and advocacy group for people with disability the american with disability act isnt a suggestion it a mandate it time our society face the fact that when it come to the cop it cannot be a mandate that is unfunded and unsupported we need more police video but it must be used correctly video wa available only in percent of the case in which an unarmed person died after an encounter with police in two case eyewitnessshot video wa crucial in showing that officer had lied to investigator in two other case video exonerated officer but in all four of these case the video wa taken by bystander or surveillance camera not by policeoperated video here another metric first observed by san jose independent police auditor walter katz last year there were zero indictment of police officer in case that did not involve video in every case in which an officer wa indicted video wa available and became an important part of the evidence supporting indictment thats an important metric we need more officer video in more place right now i believe proliferation of body and dashcam camera will mostly demonstrate that police usually get it right and perform their job with professionalism but it will also show when we are at our worst that too is important i am a strong proponent of bodyworn video but it not a easy a merely handing out the camera a weve already seen there are significant challenge to developing practical policy and procedure that bring transparency while still protecting citizen privacy and police officer due process rankandfile officer union representative where appropriate and community leader and activist should be consulted during the policybuilding process so that there are no surprise sometimes policy can be counterintuitive for a truly surprising read have a look at the how the los angeles sheriff department handled the thorny issue of whether officer should be permitted to view video before writing their report there are also logistical technological and financial barrier that need hashing out death in police custody arent always from shooting police shooting get most of the medium coverage but in nearly half of the case in which cop killed an unarmed citizen in no shot were fired at all the decedent wa killed in another manner in most of these case autopsy report found that the deceased had an abnormal reaction or complication after officer deployed tool or technique with the intent of using of nondeadly force such a stun gun or chemical spray many of these case include the drugrelated mentalhealthrelated death described previously a well a other incident in which decedent with chronic health condition or a physical disability attacked or resisted officer or others in of the case percent in which there were shooting officer deployed a taser prior to shooting to my colleague and me this is a good indication that officer were attempting to subdue suspect who ultimately died by first using nondeadly force that would be consistent with current best practice that conclusion ha frustrated some observer because activist and reformer have pointed to tasers a weapon that cause too many death part of the problem is that there a lot of confusion in the general public about a weapon potential to cause death and whether it should be considered deadly force by law practice and training without devolving into a festival of scholarly citation the law is quite clear about this deadly force is force that pose a significant risk of death or serious bodily injury legal expert have tended to agree that significant risk mean more likely than not some people have indeed died proximate to taser exposure but the number are very small independent nontaserfunded research ha repeatedly shown that the percentage of people exposed to a taser who die soon after that exposure is minuscule and even among those case it difficult to establish a causal link see for example this arizona state university study or this nij study there have been million of taser exposure and very few death in definition and in practice taser is nondeadly force our data show that in nearly a third of the case in which officer used deadly force they first attempted nondeadly force yes there have been awful example of taserproximate injury suffered when an officer used the weapon not because a suspect wa fighting but to gain control or out of anger that is generally a fireable offense and sometimes a criminal act but thats a separate issue from the case my team studied in which police officer faced a real threat and deployed a taser to stop a potentially deadly incident by using nondeadly force consider if you will the death of omar lopez last year lopez had been fighting a passenger on the septum train in philadelphia when a police officer intervened lopez bit and violently fought with the officer the officer armed with a sig sauer pistol and a baton continued to struggle and ultimately used his taser alone lopez died but the autopsy showed his cause of death to be an overdose of pcp that officer like officer in many of the incident we studied showed tremendous restraint when we credit officer who first opt for nondeadly force others are le likely to reach first for their gun i think reasonable people would agree each of these reform is individually actionable none is dependent on the others and few seem all that divisive or controversial with a couple of exception the solution for each is relatively inexpensive relatively uncomplicated and relatively understandable once we can see beyond the how many of policeinvolved killing and look instead to the why we can start to have meaningful conversation about how to reduce them http wwwwashingtonpostcom news thewatch wp

warning sign can vary wildly between men and woman both men and woman can experience chest pain when they are having a heart attack but other symptom can significantly vary according to the university of alabama dr joseph fritz if you think of someone having a heart attack chance are you will picture a scene where a man gasp clutch his chest and fall to the ground but in reality a heart attack victim could easily be a woman and the scene not be so dramatic while men and woman share some of the same symptom the university of alabama dr joseph fritz explains they can also have wildly different one both men and woman can suffer chest tightness and pain or pressure in the chest neck jaw arm or back unusual fatigue shortness of breath coughing feeling sick and vomiting are among the unpleasant symptom experienced by both gender other major symptom for men include weakness breaking out into a cold sweat dizziness major symptom for woman include sleep disturbance indigestion anxiety however dr fritz also urged people to remember each heart attack is different and symptom may not always exactly fit the mould never ignore any possible symptom of a heart attack and get medical attention immediately woman heart attack symptom can include indigestion and sleep disturbance which can be mistaken for sign of something else woman are likely than men to die within a year of their first attack woman are more likely than men to die within a year of their first heart attack according to the american heart association that is because while both gender experience chest pain a the primary symptom woman often have atypical vague symptom a well such a back or jaw pain nausea or a sense of dread earlier this year dr laxmi mehta of ohio state university said these symptom can be very challenging for the patient and the medical profession woman tend to under recognise or deny them when they do present to the emergency department it is important for these symptom to be triaged appropriately a potential heart problem otherwise the consequence are misdiagnosis delayed treatment and higher death rate even thing considered more minor health problem such a sexual health bleeding gum and even snoring could be a sign of poor heart health when the heart and artery begin to fail symptom manifest in otherwise unrelated part in the body revealed dr john erwin a cardiologist from texas am health science center dr erwin revealed six of the most common and most surprising symptom of heart disease that people need to be aware of keeping an eye out for these problem can lead to earlier detection of the disease and help save life symptom sexual dysfunction many people think of sexual dysfunction a a problem of the reproductive organ or the brain however especially in male sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of arterial disease erectile dysfunction is typically thought to be a problem of the brain or reproductive system however it can also occur because of a buildup of plaque in the artery which can lead to cardiovascular disease a buildup of plaque in the artery can cause men to have a hard time achieving or maintaining erection but for woman a drop in libido usually signal a postmenopausal state yet woman who are postmenopausal rapidly increase their risk factor for developing heart disease menopause itself doesnt cause cardiovascular disease dr erwin said while menopause doesnt cause cardiovascular disease certain hearthealth risk like change in blood pressure and cholesterol level begin around the time of menopause furthermore many woman develop a more sedentary lifestyle in that phase of their life a a result this symptom should not be ignored symptom snoring or sleep apnea few thing are more frustrating in life than trying to sleep next to a snoring person however on top of the annoyance of snoring dr erwin revealed it can actually be a sign of heart disease snoring is a common sign of sleep apnea a is morning sleepiness after a full night sleep dr erwin said sleep apnea period of time during sleep where you stop breathing is associated with many physiological change that increase the risk of both heart attack and stroke snoring may be annoying but it is a symptom of sleep apnea which can often signify heart disease snoring can also be a sign of atrial fibrillation which is an irregular often rapid heart rate that cause poor blood flow therefore detection and treatment of sleep apnea can lower a person risk of heart problem so next time you hear the person next to you snoring perhaps suggest they see a doctor instead of just complaining about the noise symptom bleeding sore or swollen gum few people would ever think that gum problem could be linked to heart disease however unhealthy gum are a symptom of periodontis that is a serious gum infection that damage the gum and can destroy the jawbone periodontis can actually lead to an increase in inflammation across the body according to dr erwein and overactivity of inflammatory pathway is a strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease and heart attack thus it recommended that people follow up regularly with their dentist for oral hygiene they should also regularly brush and floss their teeth symptom shoulder or neck constriction or aching many people feel like an elephant is sitting on their chest during a heart attack and many others experience a squeezing sensation in their arm however not all people go through those classic heart attack feeling constriction or aching in the shoulder or neck or swollen and bleeding gum may appear to be minor health problem but in reality they can be symptom of heart disease and should be checked out by a doctor instead many heart attack sufferer feel an uncomfortable sensation achiness pain or pressure in their neck jaw or shoulder for some that discomfort is the only sign of heart pain or a heart attack symptom puffy foot and leg foot and leg can swell for a variety of reason including something a minor a heat however puffy leg and foot can also be a marker of congestive heart failure thats particularly true in case where a person ha unusual shortness of breath with activity or when trying to sleep while it also true that some swelling occurs naturally throughout the day and tends to resolve overnight persistent swelling is problematic people who have constant or worsening swelling of the foot or leg should see a doctor for an evaluation of heart failure symptom indigestion or heartburn heartburn and indigestion are quite common and rarely serious but in some instance those seemingly benign burning or aching sensation in the upper abdomen can be a sign of heart pain or heart attack additionally persistent gastrointestinal distress such a intractable hiccup can also be a precursor and so when heartburn indigestion or hiccup are mixed with nausea sweating shortness of breath or lightheadedness people should seek medical attention dr erwin said it not uncommon to see people come into the emergency room after chewing on antacid for hour before they realize the pain is something more written by kate

this sound like my sister ridey i am worried if they send her home because she life alone and there is no one to help her i live mile away from her and i take care of our yr old mother it would be difficult to leave my mother to help her but she doesnt want me to help her anyway in fact it stressed her out so much when i mentioned getting someone else to stay with our mother for a while so i could come and help her out anyway i dont know what to think and i am worried that they wont get her arrhythmia under control and she may need more care in a rehab she hasnt walked in over month because of the edema and ascites and now i realize she must have been majorly out of breath in doing the littlest thing there are so many complication that i just dont know how she will be able to live by herself if they send her home before she wa diagnosed with chf she wa thinking she had bronchitis so a lot of selfdiagnosing going on i dont know if she ha been evaluated for a new liver or if she is even eligible may i ask what would keep her off the transplant list at this point just your opinion i know the usual thing that would keep her off the list like continuing to drink alcohol or smoking and of course other comorbidities is chf considered a comorbidity i would think that a transplant may help her cirrhosis and chf and any renal failure she may have i am pretty sure the chf is caused by portal hypertension or pulmonary hypertension caused by cirrhosis and i suppose this diagnosis ha stage too she said that her heart is very weak because apparently this ha been going on for some time she only saw a gastroenterologist for yr after her diagnosis of cirrhosis even though i pushed her many time to see a hepatologist instead she just didnt take her diagnosis seriously i guess sorry if i am all over the place with this and i am sorry to hear that you have this diagnosis too it is difficult to deal with if you have any more advice i would love to hear it and prayer for you too ty jun http wwwmedhelporg post show post,0

block the chemical acetylcholine which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulse between nerve cell the treatment are prescribed for a wide range of condition including parkinson disease overactive bladder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease nausea and vomiting sleeping problem high blood pressure depression and psychosis but the author warn use of ac anticholinergic medication among older adult should likely be discouraged if alternative therapy are available previous study have linked the drug with cognitive impairment increased risk of dementia and fall however the new study by indiana university school of medicine is the first to explore their impact on brain metabolism and atrophy through brain scan dr shannon risacher the university assistant professor of radiology and imaging science said these finding provide u with a much better understanding of how this class of drug may act upon the brain in way that might raise the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia given all the research evidence physician might want to consider alternative to anticholinergic medication if available when working with their older patient the impact of these drug have been know about for over a decade with a study finding drug with a strong anticholinergic effect cause cognitive problem when taken continuously for a few a day drug with a weaker effect could cause impairment within day many over the counter medicine have been linked to slower brain processing time and smaller brain the new study involved participant of whom were taking at least one medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity the participant were drawn from a national alzheimers research project the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative and the indiana memory and ageing study to identify possible physical and physiological change that could be associated with the reported effect researcher assessed the result of memory and other cognitive test positron emission test pet measuring brain metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging mri scan for brain structure patient taking anticholinergic drug performed worse than older adult not taking the drug on shortterm memory and some test of executive function which cover a range of activity such a verbal reasoning planning and problem solving anticholinergic drug user also showed lower level of glucose metabolism a biomarker for brain activity in both the overall brain and in the hippocampus a region of the brain associated with memory and which ha been identified a affected early by alzheimers disease the researcher also found significant link between brain structure revealed by the mri scan and anticholinergic drug use with the participant using anticholinergic drug having reduced brain volume and larger ventricle the cavity inside the brain professor risacher added these finding might give u clue to the biological basis for the cognitive problem associated with anticholinergic drug but additional study are needed if we are to truly understand the mechanism involved the study wa published in the journal jama neurology john smith chief executive of the proprietary association of great britain which represents maker of over the counter medicine said the medicine linked to the study were not intended to be used on a daily basis anticholinergic medicine include some overthecounter allergy and cold and flu product however they are intended for short term relief of symptom only he said it is important to note that the jama study only involved people with a mean age of in what the researcher conceded wa a small sample the study followed people who took medicine that were low medium or high in anticholinergic activity and concluded that the use of medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity should be discouraged in older adult if alternative therapy are available however due to the study limitation the researcher propose that further and more advanced study are needed anticholinergic medicine include some overthecounter allergy and cold and flu product but these are intended for short term relief of symptom and not for continuous use a in the research if anyone ha any concern about their medicine we would advise them to talk to their pharmacist there is a range of different allergy cold and flu product on the market which contain different ingredient many of which were not considered in this study and a pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable product all overthecounter medicine in the uk have been approved by the medicine and healthcare

i dont particularly like the other answer so ill chime in for background im a th year medical student sitting in a cardiologist office ill elaborate on what u chewylewisandthenews said first off is to realize how conduction in the heart work it is a very complex system but i will attempt to simplify an impulse is generated in the sa node by special cell that automatically polarize and depolarize at a certain rate this signal is sent from the sa node atrium av node purkinje fiber ventricle epinephrine and norepinephrine can modulate this automaticity by binding b receptor in addition the av node between the atrium and ventricle ha adrenergic receptor which will allow the time that the is needed to conduct an impulse through the av node to be decreased faster repolarization with these two basic principle we can move forward the way that bb work is by competing with adrenaline for a spot on the receptor when adrenaline is bound hr increase when le adrenaline is bound hr decrease if you are strictly talking about cardiac receptor then if you expose the patient to the bb their heart rate will decrease because it is blocking the adrenaline from binding the receptor but keep in mind there are thousand and thousand of receptor and not all are going to be blocked only a portion so the others can be bound by adrenaline so net effect the heart rate will decrease when you exercise your body release more adrenaline think fight or flight and thus the proportion of bb to adrenaline decrease so more adrenaline is binding to the receptor this will cause your hr to be elevated from baseline however your hr could potentially be higher w o the bb depending on how high it is for this reason your body is not able to appropriately deal with your muscle increased o demand and you will get decreased exercise tolerance very common side effect can get lactic acidosis due to increased anaerobic activity in addition to increased soreness post exercise there are more than one type of beta blocker some are cardioselective eg atenolol and these exhibit the majority of the action on the b receptor then there are other type that are nonselective propanolol b selective albuterol that are used for all sort of diseaseswhen giving a beta blocker for heart failure after a heart attack or atrial fibrillation the reasoning is not always the same for atrial fibrillation for example the electrical impulse that are being sent from the atrium to the ventricle are being generated in an abnormal pattern somewhere in the atrium and conducted through the av node to the ventricle the cardioselective bb slow the conduction of the impulse through the av node allowing the atrium to essentially send more blood into the ventricle prior to it being pumped into the aorta im not sure if by sit up you mean standing from sitting or doing sit ups but either way bb can cause you to lose consciousness if you are elderly and try to stand too quickly due to decreased perfusion of the brain orthostatic hypotension and is a common reason to take select patient off of bb i know this is a long response but i hope it helped mar http wwwredditcom r askscience comment ja howdobetablockerslowerrestingheartratebut limitdmdaj,0
chocomorsel said how urgent emergent is this surgery people live with spinal stenosis for year maybe she need a stent cabg first it crappy either way you look at it but god forbid she ha a preoperative mi with morbidity mortality on a non emergent case you know you will get eaten alive if her family or she sue that is and then of course she also need diuresis for the chf better glucose control etc i had a patient i cancelled recently whose cardiologist had recently told him he needed a defibrillator but it never happened for some reason no one know why i said go see the cardiologist let him write me a nice little note of why this hasnt happened yet with your know nonperfusing arrthymia history and then we can talk sound like the wall motion abnormality need further exploration sorry i missed the wmas that is more concerning to me than the lvef you all are of course right all i am saying is that she will come back probably in the same shape except with the surgeon documenting that she ha to have the surgery which is basically what we need and she could get paralyzed in the meanwhile which is why i whould have a risk benefit discussion with her and the surgeon about the value of postponing jun http forumsstudentdoctornet thread raspinecase post,0

aarhus university many dane are prescribed nsaid for the treatment of painful condition fever and inflammation but the treatment also come with side effect including the risk of ulcer and increased blood pressure a major new study now gather all research in the area this show that arthritis medicine is particularly dangerous for heart patient and also that older type of arthritis medicine which have not previously been in focus also appear to be dangerous for the heart it been wellknown for a number of year that newer type of nsaid what are known a cox inhibitor increase the risk of heart attack for this reason a number of these newer type of nsaid have been taken off the market again we can now see that some of the older nsaid type particularly diclofenac are also associated with an increased risk of heart attack and apparently to the same extent a several of the type that were taken off the market say morten schmidt md and phd from aarhus university who is in charge of the research project he add this is worrying because these older type of medicine are frequently used throughout the western world and in many country available without prescription each year more than per cent of the western country collect a prescription for nsaid this figure increase with age sixty per cent of the adult population in denmark collect at least one prescription for an nsaid within a tenyear period heart patient are no exception and previous study have shown that up to forty per cent of danish patient with heart failure or previous heart attack are prescribed nsaid the study which wa carried out in collaboration between european university and hospital including a number of leading european heart specialist is today being published in the most prestigious european journal of heart medicine european heart journal new guideline in the study the researcher have gathered all research on the use of nsaid in patient with heart disease the survey mean that the european society of cardiology ha now for the first time formulated a number of recommendation about what doctor should consider before prescribing painkiller to their patient when doctor issue prescription for nsaid they must in each individual case carry out a thorough assessment of the risk of heart complication and bleeding nsaid should only be sold over the counter when it come with an adequate warning about the associated cardiovascular risk in general nsaid are not be used in patient who have or are at highrisk of cardiovascular disease say another of the author professor in cardiology christian torppedersen aalborg university denmark consumption should be reduced even more for a number of year danish researcher have made significant contribution in the field one result of this work ha been a reduction in the use of diclofenac in denmark however according to morten schmidt there is still room for improvement many european country consume more of these drug than denmark but we can still do better and it often the case that paracetamol physiotherapy mild opioids or other type of nsaid with le risk for the heart would be better for the patient of course the recommendation that have been introduced following our study and it review of the heartrelated risk are a big step in the right direction in relation to patient safety say morten schmidt fact about arthritis medicine nsaid nsaid is an abbreviation for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and is used to treat a wide range of disease in particular disorder in the muscular and bone system where the drug counteracts swelling pain and limitation in movement associated with inflammation nsaid are not antibiotic and therefore do not help to fight infection caused by bacteria nsaid are in denmark sold both in low do ibuprofen mg tablet without a prescription and in higher do and other type with a prescription read the scientific article http eurheartjoxfordjournalsorg content early eurheartjehv contact information aarhus university and aarhus university hospital department of clinical epidemiology london school of hygiene tropical medicine noncommunicable disease epidemiology telephone mar http clinicalnewsorg commonpainkillersaremoredangerousthanwethink,0

glycine the musclebuilding brainboosting amino acid that benefit the entire body while you may not be familiar with the term specifically you use glycine every day to strengthen your body and frankly allow it to work properly this amino acid is essential for many different muscle cognitive and metabolic function it help break down and transport nutrient like glycogen and fat to be used by cell for energy and in the process it support strong immune digestive and nervous system in the human body glycine is found in high concentration in the skin connective tissue of the joint and muscle tissue one of the key amino acid used to form collagen and gelatin glycine can be found in bone broth and other protein source in fact glycine along with many other nutrient like proline and arginine is part of what give superfood bone broth it amazing healing ability glycine benefit u according to research done by the department of cell and developmental biology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill glycine can be used to help lower symptom in people suffering from condition like ulcer arthritis leaky gut syndrome diabetes kidney and heart failure neurobehavioral disorder chronic fatigue sleep disorder and even certain cancer amino acid such a glycine can be found in supplement form but it easy and probably even more beneficial to acquire them from natural food source some of the many health benefit of glycine include helping build lean muscle mass preventing scaropenia muscle loss muscle wasting or deterioration playing a role in the production of human growth hormone boosting mental performance and memory helping prevent stroke and seizure protecting skin from sign of aging or cellular mutation protecting collagen in joint and reducing joint pain improving flexibility and range of motion stabilizing blood sugar and lowering risk for type diabetes improving sleep quality lowering inflammation and free radical damage by increasing glutathione production reducing risk for certain type of cancer building the lining of the gastrointestinal tract producing bile salt and digestive enzyme helping reduce allergic and autoimmune reaction boosting energy level and fighting fatigue helping produce red blood cell fighting the effect of stress and anxiety helping control symptom of seizure schizophrenia and mental disorder among all of these benefit here are several key way glycine is used in the body promotes muscle growth glycine ha been found to help inhibit the deterioration of valuable protein tissue that form muscle and boost muscle recovery in fact it known a an antiaging amino acid because of how it help maintain lean muscle mass into old age stimulates the secretion of human growth hormone prevents loss of cartilage in joint and even improves daytime energy physical performance and mental capability all important for athlete glycine is used during the biosynthesis of creatine which provides muscle with a direct source of fuel to repair damage and grow back stronger it also help provide cell with energy thanks to it role in the conversion of nutrient from your diet helping feed hungry muscle tissue and boosting endurance strength and performance it also ha benefit when it come to hormone production and regulation helping the body naturally synthesize steroid hormone that regulate the ratio of fat to muscle mass and control energy expenditure repair and protects joint and cartilage together with other amino acid found in bone broth especially proline glycine play a part in the formation of collagen promoting the growth and function of joint tendon and ligament approximately onethird of collagen is composed of glycine and collagen is crucial for forming connective tissue that keep joint flexible and able to withstand shock this is why collagen hydrolysate is often used for the treatment of degenerative joint disease like osteoarthritis a people get older it especially important to consume enough protein amino acid in order to repair damaged tissue within joint that suffer due to ongoing free radical damage glycine is essential for the formation of stretchy flexible cartilage help heal damaged joint and can prevent loss of mobility and functionality in older adult improves digestion amino acid including glycine and proline help rebuild tissue that line the digestive tract keeping food particle and bacteria inside the gut where they belong rather than allowing tiny opening to form that pa particle to the bloodstream where they trigger inflammation glycine help form two of the most important substance that make up the gut lining collagen and gelatin collagen and gelatine help people with food allergy and sensitivity tolerate food more easily can soothe the lining of the gi tract in people with inflammatory bowel disease or indigestion including leaky gut syndrome ibs crohn ulcerative colitis and acid reflux and even promote probiotic balance and growth within the gi tract glycine also act like a metabolic fuel it needed to manufacture bile nucleic acid creatine phosphate and porphyrin to be used to break down nutrient from your diet for example it help break down fat by aiding with the production of bile acid and help transport glycogen to cell to be used for energy in the form of atp evidence also show that glycine can help stabilize blood sugar level leading to more lasting energy and preventing sugar craving and fatigue slows the effect of aging and build the immune system glycine help form glutathione a valuable antioxidant thats used to prevent cellular damage and various sign of aging a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that although glutathione deficiency in elderly people occurs because of a marked reduction in synthesis supplementation with the glutathione precursor cysteine and glycine fully restores glutathione synthesis this help increase concentration and lower level of oxidative stress and oxidant damage that lead to aging in certain study glycine ha even been found to help prevent cellular mutation that lead to cancer there some evidence that using targeted amino acid therapy can prevent the growth of cancerous cell by cutting off their energy supply and help turn down inflammation which is linked to numerous other chronic condition besides cancer calm the nerve and feed the brain glycine is beneficial for supporting cognitive performance and the central nervous system because of how it help regulate the metabolic synthesis of certain nutrient that the brain and nerve use for energy it help regulate nerve impulse throughout the body by balancing electrolyte level such a calcium chloride and potassium due to it role in both nerve and neurotransmitter function glycine also ha implication for helping improve sleep mental performance bodily sensation mood memory and behavior for example glycine work with other amino acid including taurine and gammaamino butyric acid gaba a an inhibitory neurotransmitter some evidence show that glycine can help reduce hyperactivity in the brain and even play a role in the treatment or prevention of mental disorder including learning disability schizophrenia bipolar disorder manic depression and epilepsy certain study have shown that glycine help reduce psychotic symptom stroke and seizure when used with other supplement a part of a holistic treatment plan for mental cognitive illness fight fatigue and promotes restful sleep due to it role in the central nervous system and the digestive system glycine can help boost energy level balance blood sugar and prevent fatigue it can even be used to calm anxiety or nervousness that keep you up at night and get in the way of getting good sleep plus it help directly bring nutrient to cell and tissue for energy at all time of the day according to research done by the japanese society of sleep research glycine supplement improve sleep quality lessen daytime sleepiness and improve performance of memory recognition task one of it most important function is helping carry out the biosynthesis of heme a component of haemoglobin that help produce and maintain red blood cell red blood cell help carry oxygen around the body support cellular function and provide the tissue heart and brain with energy in fact glycine is often used in supplement meant to improve energy in athlete fight fatigue caused by anemia and help regulate blood sugar level what is glycine classified a a nonessential also called conditional amino acid glycine can be made in small amount by the human body itself but many people can benefit from consuming a lot more from their diet thanks to it numerous beneficial role nutritional information and fact about glycine glycine is the second most widespread amino acid found in human enzyme and protein which is why it ha role in nearly every part of the body it one of amino acid used to make protein in the body which build the tissue that form organ joint and muscle of the protein in the body it concentrated in collagen the most abundant protein in human and many mammal and also gelatin a substance made from collagen some of the most attractive attribute include promoting better muscle growth healing the lining of the gi tract and slowing down the loss of cartilage in joint and skin while highprotein food like meat and dairy product do contain some glycine the best source collagen and gelatin can be hard to get these protein are not found in most cut of meat and instead are obtained from consuming part of animal that today most people throw away skin bone connective tissue tendon and ligament people who are ill recovering from surgery taking medication that hinder certain metabolic process or who are under a lot of stress can all use extra glycine for recovery glycine recipe supplement getting more glycine into your diet is probably even easier than you think bone broth is a great source of naturally occurring glycine and other amino acid is inexpensive simple to make at home and ha farreaching health benefit bone broth which is made from slowly simmering animal part including bone skin and tendon in stock contains natural collagen which release important amino acid and other substance that are often missing from the typical western diet however if youre not willing to consume bone broth for example youre a vegetarian or vegan glycine can be obtained from plant food too plantbased source include bean vegetable like spinach kale cauliflower cabbage and pumpkin plus fruit like banana and kiwi other than bone broth glycine can also be found in complete source of protein animal protein including meat dairy product poultry egg and fish dont forget that glycine is also found in high amount in gelatin a substance made from collagen thats used in certain food product and sometimes for cooking or food prep gelatin isnt commonly eaten in large amount but can be added to recipe when making some gelatin dessert yogurt raw cheese or even ice cream here are several simple recipe you can make at home to boost your glycine intake homemade chicken bone broth recipe homemade beef bone broth recipe kale chip recipe cauliflower pizza crust recipe turkey chili with adzuki bean recipe when it come to glycine supplement and dosage recommendation here what you need to know while some food especially animal protein and bone broth do provide some glycine amount tend to be small overall so you need to consume supplement if you want to obtain a higher dose there is no established daily requirement or upper limit of glycine at this time it believed that most people already get around two gram of glycine daily from their diet but need differ a lot depending on someone level of activity and state of health depending on the symptom youre looking to resolve you might benefit from consuming time the average amount or even more not all protein amino acid supplement are created equal always look for highquality brand sold from reputable company and consume foodbased supplement whenever possible because glycine is a natural amino acid there not much risk for consuming too much from your diet in supplement form higher do of glycine between gram have been used safely to help resolve chronic condition like mental disorder but this amount should be taken with supervision from a doctor it not known if giving glycine supplement to child pregnant or breastfeeding woman or people with kidney or liver disease is safe or a good idea so avoid using glycine in these case for now glycine supplement can also interact with certain medication when taken in high do such a those used by people with mental disorder including clozapine although for most people glycine is very safe especially in food form if you take medication it always a good idea to get your doctor opinion when you begin to use any supplement final thought on glycine glycine is a conditional nonessential amino acid found in bone broth meat poultry egg dairy product and certain bean and veggie it help form collagen and gelatin substance that are important for building connective tissue throughout the body glycine is beneficial in both food and supplement form for people with joint pain digestive disorder like ibs ibd or food sensitive fatigue trouble sleeping anxiety and low immunity there is no recommended daily amount of glycine or upper limit and study have found that it can be used safely in high do up to gram daily when necessary however estimate show that most people eating a standard western diet consume only about two gram of glycine from their diet daily most likely because concentrated source like animal tendon skin and bone are often thrown out read next what is collagen way collagen can

invention the creator never lived to see by emilios manolidis toptenz april throughout history the work of inventor engineer polymath and entrepreneur have advanced mankind in both small step and giant leap forward but not all of those design came to life while the heart of their creator were still beating sometimes it wa an abrupt death other time it wa lack of funding or public interest some invention were even vague or hastily scrawled design in the originator notebook but many of them were finally built sometimes hundred of year after that person died viola organista leonardo da vinci notorious for being cryptic and vague the polymath leonardo da vinci included in his codex atlanticus around the design of an organ able of producing string sound like a violin but which operated with a keyboard like a piano leonardo having the attention span of a true genius which is to say none at all never bothered building it however his design although not extremely detailed gave a good idea to future craftsman about how to go about creating one around an instrument called geigenwerk wa built by the german han haiden it resembled leonardo original idea but operated on a slightly different mechanical principle the most faithful interpretation of da vincis schematic so far is the organ finished in by slawomir zubrzycki year after it intellectual father passed away a truly unique organ it ha raised no small amount of musician eyebrow about how existing musical arrangement can be played with it typewriter henry mill henry mill wa an english new river company engineer in he obtained a patent for an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letter singly or progressively one after another although vaguely described mill conception ha been regarded a a first clear proposal of creating what later came to be known a a typewriter mill died in but the potential existence of such a machine got the attention of among others people trying to facilitate communication for blind people in charles thurber constructed a machine for this purpose finally in year after mill death the american christopher sholes and carlos glidden put together what can be recognized today in form and function a a typewriter revolutionizing the way people put their thought into paper clifton suspension bridge isambard kingdom brunel one of britain most revered figure isambard kingdom brunel is considered the founding father of modern civil engineering he wa only year old when in he wa appointed project engineer for constructing a bridge above the river avon in bristol after several rejection and conflict with the committee tasked to approve submitted design the clifton suspension bridge wa not an easy project at the time of construction it had the longest span of any bridge in the world further delay and setback left the bridge unfinished at the time of his death being a heavy smoker brunel died of a stroke in construction wa continued based on brunels design and the bridge wa finally finished in a fitting memorial for the late engineer a well a an impressive landmark in it own right today standing meter long between it two meter high tower and meter above the river it core infrastructure remains unaltered brunel had to push the limit of civil engineering to the point that even modern calculation leave engineer in awe of how perfectly accurate and balanced his design were lear fan bill lear in the late s bill lear inventor and founder of the lear jet corporation had an idea for a unique aircraft type made almost entirely of composite material like carbon graphite it would have the same durability at about half the weight of typical aluminum alloy it twin engine and rearmounted propeller would make it about a fast a other jet at that time the u federal aviation administration having reservation about gearbox and aerodynamics performance refused to give the project the green light for production lear didnt live long enough to perfect his dream dying of leukemia in his desire to have the jet completed wa so great that a a dying wish he told his wife moya to finish it with the help of british government funding the prototype made it maiden flight in never having entered commercial production three finished model are now in display at the museum of flight in seattle washington at the frontier of flight museum in dallas texas and in the back lot of faa facility in oklahoma city demologos steam warship robert fulton the first warship ever to be propelled by a steam engine the united state navy design for the u demologos began in robert fulton a renowned engineer and inventor imagined a ship unlike any other heavily armed and armored and it twin hull had a paddlewheel between them the engine wa on one hull while the boiler were on the other a floating fortress wellsuited for local defense it weighed displacement ton and wa meter long in before the ship wa completed fulton jumped in the icy water of the hudson river to save a friend who fell in struck by pneumonia which quickly developed into pulmonary tuberculosis he died the same year shortly after the demologos wa fully finished and the navy renamed it the fulton to honor the inventor the warship never saw any real action due to the end of the war of and it wa destroyed in due to a gunpowder explosion omnia dir airship enrico forlanini there wa a time where airship were considered a good idea for passenger transport after the great war italian inventor and aeronautical pioneer enrico forlanini sought to put into air traffic a new airship type with unprecedented maneuverability in he presented the design of omnia dir a meter long dirigible with cubic meter capacity what made it special aside from forlaninis already established expertise wa the addition of jet propulsion to the classic engine and propeller scheme highpressure air jet installed at the ship bow and stern offered the ship unbelievable for the time maneuvering speed both on ground and in the air forlanini died in before the ship wa completed and aside for a test flight it never entered mass production it innovative design however became a point of reference and helped study and develop auxiliary thrust technology in aircraft automatic computing engine ace alan turing by the time world war ii had ended building a computer wa entirely possible anyone with half a million dollar and a really big room could have one what wa missing from the greater picture wa a generalpurpose computer existing model were very limited in what they could do they could very specific task and nothing more it wa no wonder that the mathematical genius alan turing wa summoned to build the very first electronic storedprogram generalpurpose digital computer in he presented his design to the uk national physical laboratory work began in ace operated nothing like modern system do a it logic resembled more biological neuron function rather than the boolean logic all modern computer are based on turing stayed a few month on the project leaving npl technician baffled about how to carry on the pilot model finished in wa pretty fast for the time though not exactly what turing had envisioned turing died of cyanide poisoning in and the first fullscale ace model wa completed in pendulum clock galileo galilei when he wa not being bullied by the inquisition galileo observed and recorded physical phenomenon one of them wa the back and forth motion of a suspended weight the physic behind pendulum motion is no small deal it study paved the way for an entire branch of physic namely the harmonic oscillator a model that ha helped represent and explain problem ranging from planetary motion to quantum mechanic galileo wa the first to notice that contrary to common intuition the period of swing of a pendulum is independent of it swinging arc in galileo wa year old and blind he had fully described the inner work of a pendulum clock and his son vincenzo tried to make one without success galileo died in early leaving a lot of finely formulated physical theory to future scientist it wa in year later that the dutch astronomer and physicist christiaan huygens built the world first pendulum clock hipower pistol john browning during the s the french military requested a handgun that should be compact have an ammo capacity of at least round could be easily assembled and disassembled and could be produced at a low cost john browning a legend among gun designer and salesman filed the patent in a thumb safety and external hammer were also incorporated in the design browning died in of heart failure and the design wa handed to and perfected by the belgian dieudonne saive finally introducing the gun in although not adopted by the french army at the time the hipower is one of the most recognizable widely used and most heavily sought firearm by collector many conflict in history had both side using it due to it reliability and power for it size it is

babbage an english mathematician and philosopher envisioned a machine able to perform all those calculation automatically thus eliminating error conceived a a digital device it used toothed wheel to represent and carry over digit from it wa not only suited for solving complex mathematical problem but it also had temporary data storage a well a the ability of printing the result onto soft metal funded with by the british government babbage hired joseph clement a skilled engineer and began working on the engine by clement refused to work further due to payment dispute and the government ceased funding the project after having spent more than babbage died in having lived his last year in bitterness for not seeing his work complete in year later the london science museum finished

i wa diagnosed with m in and put on avonex inj for almost a year then the mri showed brain lesion and the report said no m pattern or demylinization my pcp said get another opinion so i am waiting to see another neuro dr march i have recently had a left leg dvt and pe enlarged heart and atrophy of the left ventricle i had several other clot a well in my lung now i am confused a to what is going on my rdw is high and my ldh i am to have another ct again in week i am on welfarin i am not taking the avonex anymore is this possibly a cancer not showing up yet i do have fibrosis of the lung a well can you give me some help here mary answer hi mary sorry but we are not allowed to give specific medical advice on this site but i will help a much a i can how old are you the suggestion to get an opinion by a neuro expert is a good one i think it highly unlikely that the brain lesion is cancer the circulatory and cardiac symptom are certainly of concern ha a cardiologist discussed them with you i can also see no connection between m and the lung fibrosis did you have a history of other condition before the m diagnosis did they rule out lupus or another autoimmune disease do you have any occupational exposure to lung damaging agent or a smoking history i hope this is of some help i am happy to answer more question or help you interpret what your doctor tell you all the best michael followup hi michael i am a prior smoker but quit yr ago i do have copd and i have not been tested for lupus is it possible to have lesion with that i just want to know what to ask this new neurologist what would be good for mw i wa told to get another mri of the spinal canal seeing it ha been nearly yr now he wa an m specialist and he said that if the lesion are on the brain they are most likely on the spine too i have been told i have microvascular change in the brain and stenosis in the lower leg there is some vascular peticei i have not had a cardio workup in several year but my nurse came out and suggested i do see one seeing i do have cardiomegaly and left v hypertrophy maybe caused from the clot i cant get my walfarin stableized yet i will find out more when i go for my visit march thanks a bunch answer hi mary lupus is a much more varied disease and can affect many more organ system in the body but they probably would have considered that previously but it doe not hurt to ask the copd would explain the fibrosis in the lung but i dont understand shat is causing your clotting problem or the cardiac condition so it is good that you see a cardiologist regularly and the spine mri also seems warranted again i dont see an obvious connection between the m and the clotting or heart condition so that would be one thing to explore with the neurologist i hope this ha helped a bit best of luck michael followup may http wwwcancerforumsnet viewtopicphpft,1
hi there are several cause for fatigue you reported some linked to copd and others to heart the copd is a progressive disease that make it difficult to exit air from the lung and need quite strict treatment not to worse the treatment can be done with medication smoking cessation and in advanced case to the use of home oxygen therapy the cardiac cause are related to losswhen there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of it ability to pump blood forward and liquid become accumulated in various part of the body especially the lung causing pulmonary edema this fluid accumulation in the lung is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness this condition is known a heart failure and there are several treatment for this problem including cardiopulmonary rehabilitation medication and visit by multidisciplinary team i suggest you contact your cardiologist for further information and determine which therapy are needed to solve the problem hope i have answered your question if you have any further question i will be happy to help you wish you good health mar http wwwhealthcaremagiccom question whatcausesfatiguewhilesufferingfromcopd answer,0

dr hyman my father ha heart disease his father did too and im obviously concerned about my own heart writes this week house call what can i do to prevent heart disease most importantly please know while genetics contributes to some degree many other factor completely within your control can contribute to or reverse heart disease genetics load the gun but environment pull the trigger the way you eat how much you exercise how you manage stress and your exposure to environmental toxin all contribute to thing like high cholesterol high blood pressure high blood sugar and of course heart disease the current way doctor treat heart disease is misguided because they treat the risk factor not the cause to think we can treat heart disease by lowering cholesterol lowering blood pressure and lowering blood sugar with medication is like mopping up the floor while the sink overflow instead we need to ask what cause these risk factor like high blood pressure high blood sugar or abnormal cholesterol in the first place spoiler alert these are not medication deficiency we treat these problem with medication but study have increasingly shown that treating these risk factor ha only little benefit or none at all research show changing your lifestyle can be a more powerful intervention to prevent heart disease than any medication the epic study published in the archive of internal medicine studied how people adhered to four simple behavior not smoking exercising hour a week eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight adhering to those four behavior alone prevented percent of diabetes percent of heart attack percent of stroke and percent of all cancer likewise the interheart study published in the lancet in followed people in country researcher found changing lifestyle could prevent at least percent of all heart disease other research show lifestyle intervention becomes more effective than almost any other traditional medical intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease hypertension heart failure stroke cancer diabesity and death from all cause your environment in turn change gene expression subsequently modulating inflammation oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction these are the reason we get sick and develop heart disease along with other problem thats actually good news addressing and fixing the root cause benefit most chronic disease these modification will make you feel alive and healthy without the side effect of medication occasionally i will use medication if i feel a patient show a strong genetic predisposition for heart disease or if significant heart disease already exists under those circumstance i carefully weigh a medication risk and benefit at the same time most patient can achieve the benefit of most medication through lifestyle change dr david jenkins from the university of toronto compared treatment with statin drug the number one cholesterol medication with a diet rich in viscous fiber almond soy and plant sterol researcher in this study found that while they created almost equal benefit diet became more effective to lower inflammation and homocysteine a risk marker for heart disease ive likewise had patient lower their cholesterol sometimes over point simply by incorporating positive dietary and lifestyle change simply put preventative medicine becomes the best form of medicine these simple modification can go a long way to preventing or reversing heart disease eat a healthy diet increase healthy whole food rich in nutrient and phytonutrients plant molecule aim for at least to serving of colorful fruit and vegetable every day these food are loaded with diseasefighting vitamin mineral fiber antioxidant and antiinflammatory molecule steady your blood sugar study show blood sugar imbalance contribute to heart disease stabilize your blood sugar with protein healthy fat and healthy carbohydrate at every meal never eat carbohydrate alone and avoid processed sugar with carbohydrate i discus this more indepth in the blood sugar solution day detox diet increase your fiber work your way up to gram of fiber per day highfiber food include vegetable nut seed and lowersugar fruit like berry if that becomes a challenge try a fiber supplement such a pgx konjac fiber or glucomannan avoid processed junk food that includes soda juice and diet drink which adversely impact sugar and lipid metabolism research show liquidsugar calorie become the biggest contributor to obesity diabetes and heart disease dont be fooled that percent fruit juice is healthy juice are essentially pure liquid sugar because processing strip away the fruit fiber increase omega fatty acid eat antiinflammatory food like coldwater fish including salmon sardine and herring a well a flaxseed and even seaweed healthy fat actually benefit your heart by improving your overall cholesterol profile it also lower the small dangerous ldl particle that contribute to heart disease by converting them into light fluffy safe ldl particle i discus how healthy fat can help you achieve and maintain good health in my new book eat fat get thin eliminate all hydrogenated fat hydrogenated fat lurks in margarine shortening processed oil and many baked good and processed food like cooky and cracker even when the label state no trans fat the word hydrogenated indicates that the product contains trans fat in one or more of the ingredient use healthy oil instead like coconut oil rich in mediumchain triglyceride or mcts extravirgin organic coldpressed olive oil organic sesame oil and other nut oil you can now find mct oil in my store avoid or reduce alcohol intake alcohol can raise triglyceride contribute to fatty liver and create sugar imbalance reducing or eliminating alcohol intake lower inflammation which contributes to heart disease and nearly every other chronic disease take quality supplement combined with a healthy diet and exercise program supplement can dramatically improve cardiovascular health take a good multivitamin mineral along with a purified fish oil supplement that contains to milligram a day of epa dha you might need higher do if you have low hdl and high triglyceride i also recommend a fiber supplement such a pgx konjac fiber or gluccomanan to lower cholesterol and balance blood sugar level you can find these and other supplement in my store get out and move research show to minute of cardiovascular exercise at least five time a week can benefit your heart after all your heart is a muscle and muscle need exercise if you feel stronger and more capable highintensity interval training also called burst training and strength training help build muscle reduce body fat composition and maintain strong bone you simply cannot age successfully without sufficient optimal exercise manage stress level stress alone can cause a heart attack sadly chronic stress often trigger a cascade of event that cause that final fatal heart attack among it problem stress increase inflammation raise your cholesterol and blood sugar increase blood pressure and even make your blood more likely to clot find your pause button to manage stress and relax yoga tai chi meditation breathing technique and guided imagery can lower stress many patient find my ultracalm cd help dial down stress level very effectively i want to hear from you have

new detail possible treatment in the link between heart disease and sleep apnea people with obstructive sleep apnea are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease the relationship between the two condition is complex and the mechanism by which they may trigger or exacerbate one another are not yet well understood but the fundamental connection between osa and cardiovascular disease is strong study indicated that obstructive sleep apnea is time more prevalent among people with cardiovascular disease than those without research show that the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is higher among older adult who also have osa sleep apnea is linked to several cardiovascular condition including high blood pressure arrhythmia heart disease heart failure and stroke two common condition cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among adult in the united state obstructive sleep apnea affect an estimated million or more u adult with the great majority of case remaining undiagnosed and untreated deepening our understanding of the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease is critical to public health how osa may trigger heart disease recent research reveals new detail in the relationship between heart disease and sleep apnea and also point to a possible treatment for lowering cardiovascular risk for people with osa scientist at columbia university medical center found that statin a type of drug used to treat cholesterol may reverse the damage done to the cardiovascular system that appears to occur a a consequence of sleep apnea the scientist also identified new information about the process by which obstructive sleep apnea may inflict cardiovascular damage according to the study people with osa exhibit abnormality in a protein that help to limit cellular inflammation the dysfunction with this particular protein known a cd appears to leave people with obstructive sleep apnea more vulnerable to inflammation which is regarded a a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease the study included people including with a diagnosis of sleep apnea and who did not meet the diagnostic criterion for osa scientist analyzed blood sample from all participant looking in particular at endothelial cell cell that line the interior wall of blood vessel the protein cd is normally found in these cell lining blood vessel wall from within the cell lining cd work to prevent the buildup of inflammatory protein on the surface of cell scientist found that among people with obstructive sleep apnea cd level were elevated compared to those without osa researcher found something else both surprising and significant in people with sleep apnea cd protein wa found primarily within the interior section of blood vessel cell rather than in the cell lining a would have been expected and wa the case among people without sleep apnea at a greater distance from cell wall the cd protein wa le able to exert it protective effect against inflammation the result a greater buildup of inflammatory protein on the cell of people with obstructive sleep apnea researcher found statin a solution included in the study were a small number of subject with osa who were already being treated with statin among this subgroup of sleep apnea sufferer researcher discovered that cd remained in place in the lining of cell in a position to inhibit inflammation similar to people without osa additional research found that in people with osa the inward migration of cd is influenced by cholesterol this finding is important opening the possibility of statin use a a therapy to prevent cardiovascular damage in people with obstructive sleep apnea further study need to take place before well know whether statin can serve a a viable treatment to prevent or reverse the cardiovascular damage from osa but this is a promising lead more broadly this study also provides some much needed insight into the process by which obstructive sleep apnea affect cardiovascular health and function the disrupted breathing of osa obstructive sleep apnea involves repeated interruption to normal breathing during sleep during sleep the airway temporarily narrow or close altogether compromising or fully interrupting breath flow these episode of shallow or paused breathing can last a few second or more than a minute in case of mild sleep apnea breathing is interrupted between time an hour in case of moderate to severe sleep apnea breathing is interrupted time an hour or more people with osa are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease a well a other serious medical condition including type diabetes and depression they are also at significantly greater risk for accident and injury in large part because of the tiredness and fatigue that accompany this sleep disorder undiagnosed and untreated why do so many case of obstructive sleep apnea go undiagnosed often people with sleep apnea arent aware of their most obvious symptom since they occur during sleep snoring and other sound of disrupted breathing during sleep can be sign of sleep apnea bed partner are frequently the people who are aware of these symptom before the sleeper themselves even when people are aware they snore or breathe with difficulty during sleep they too often dont address these issue with their physician and physician themselves often dont make the topic of sleep and question about sleepdisordered breathing a priority during physicals and check ups whats more many people arent aware of the symptom of obstructive sleep apnea that exist in addition to snoring dry mouth or sore throat upon waking headache especially in the morning severe tiredness during the daytime trouble with concentration memory problem mood issue including depression anxiety and irritability the regular presence of any of these symptom even in the absence of snoring warrant conversation with a physician treatment work for osa sleep apnea can wreak havoc with nightly rest undermining health and daily performance the good news is that osa can be treated effectively with a number of different therapy cpap continuous positive airway pressure therapy is highly effective in reducing or eliminating sleep apnea and is generally the recommended treatment for more severe case of osa other form of pap or positive airway pressure are also used to treat osa oral appliance device worn inside the mouth during sleep can also significantly improve sleep apnea and are increasingly recommended for mild and moderate sleep apnea a well a for people who have difficulty using cpap therapy positional therapy switching sleeping position is the simplest form of sleep apnea treatment and can be effective particularly in case of mild osa airway obstruction and disrupted breathing are more likely to occur when sleeping on one back moving to a sidesleeping position can reduce the frequency of interruptedbreathing episode and may even resolve mild sleep apnea in some case lifestyle modification including losing weight also help to alleviate osa we need to improve our diagnosis rate osa and get more people into treatment for sleep apnea and the other health complication that often accompany the disorder this latest research provides some significant new insight into how sleep apnea work to undermine heart health and may indicate a new way to treat and protect people with sleep apnea against cardiovascular risk sweet dream michael j breus phd the sleep doctor wwwthesleepdoctorcom this feed and it content are the

by ashish jha md reducing hospital use because hospital are expensive and often cause harm there ha been a big focus on reducing hospital use this focus ha been the underpinning for numerous policy intervention most notable of which is the affordable care act hospital readmission reduction program hrrp which penalizes hospital for higher than expected readmission rate the motivation behind hrrp is simple the readmission rate the proportion of discharged patient who return to the hospital within day had been more or le flat for year and reducing this rate would save money and potentially improve care so it wa big news when a the hrrp penalty kicked in government official started reporting that the national readmission rate for medicare patient wa declining rising use of observation status but during this time another phenomenon wa coming into focus increasing use of observation status when a patient need hospital service there are two option that patient can be admitted for inpatient care or can be admitted to observation when patient are admitted to observation they essentially still get inpatient care but technically they are outpatient for a variety of reason weve seen a decline in patient admitted to inpatient status and a rise in those going to observation status these two phenomenon a drop in readmission and an increase in observation seemed related i and others spoke publicly about our concern that the drop in readmission wa being driven by increasing observation admission an analysis by david himmelstein and steffie woolhandler in the health affair blog suggested that most of the drop in readmission could be accounted for both by increase in observation status and by increase in return to the emergency department that did not lead to readmission two month later a piece by claire noelmiller and keith lund also in the health affair blog found that the hospital with the biggest drop in readmission appeared to have big increase in their use of observation status it seemed like much of the drop in readmission wa about reclassifying people a observation and administratively lowering readmission without changing care new data now come a terrific high quality study in the new england journal of medicine that take this topic head on the author examine directly whether the hospital that lowered their readmission rate were the same one that increased their observation status and find no correlation none if youre ever looking for a scatter plot of two variable that are completely uncorrelated look no further than figure of the paper the best reading of the evidence prior to the study did not turn out to be the truth it reminds me of the period we were all convinced based on excellent observational data that hormone replacement therapy wa lifesaving for woman with cardiovascular disease and that became the standard of care until someoneconducted a randomized trial and found that hrt provided little benefit to these patient thats why we do research it move our knowledge forward where are we now so where doe this leave u is the acas readmission policy a home run here what we know the hrrp ha most likely we have no control led to fewer patient being readmitted to the hospital second the hrrp doe not seem responsible for the increase in observation stay here what we dont know is a drop in readmission a good thing for patient it may seem obvious that it is but if you think about it you realize that readmission rate is a utilization measure not a patient outcome it a measure of how often patient use inpatient service within day of discharge utilization measure unto themselves dont tell you whether care is good or bad so the real question is ha the hrrp improved the underlying quality of care it might be that we have improved on care coordination communication between hospital and primary care provider and ensuring good followup that likely happened in some place alternatively it might be that we have just made it much harder for that older frail woman with heart failure sitting in the emergency room to get admitted if she wa discharged in the last day that too ha likely happened in some place but how much of it is the former versus the latter until we can answer that question we wont know whether care is better or not beyond understanding why readmission have fallen we also dont know how hrrp ha affected the other thing that hospital ought to focus on such a mortality and infection rate if your parent wa admitted to the hospital with pneumonia what would be your top priority most people would say that they would like their parent not to die the second might be to avoid serious complication like a healthcare associated infection or a fall that lead to a hip fracture another might be to be treated with dignity and respect yes avoiding being readmitted would be nice but for me at least it pale in comparison to avoiding death and disability we know little about the potential spillover effect of the readmission penalty on the thing that matter the most so here we are a good news study that say readmission are down because fewer people are being readmitted to the hospital not because people are being admitted to observation status thats important but the real challenge is in figuring out whether patient are better off are they more likely to be alive after hospitalization do they have fewer functional limitation le pain and suffering until we answer those question itll be hard to know whether this policy is making the kind of difference we want and thats the point of science using data to answer those question because we all can have our opinion but ultimately it the data that count ashish jha md mph ashishkjha is the c boyden gray associate

there currently no treatment for cardiac fibrosis a leading cause of heart failure but new research suggests there may be a way to prevent it the study found specific trigger that activate the development of fibrosis blocking the trigger through the use of a bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring according to result in a preclinical model the bottom line is that this show for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable this is something that nobody ha ever seen before say marek michalak coprincipal investigator and a professor in biochemistry at the university of alberta cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart inevitably it lead to heart failure and eventually death the bottom line is that this show for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable luis agellon coprincipal investigator and a professor at mcgill university school of dietetics and human nutrition say the finding offer hope to those who are living with heart failure prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to continue to function even if at a reduced capacity currently patient with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis improving their quality of life will do wonder for these individual say agellon fibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure once a person is diagnosed with heart failure about percent will die within the first year next step clinical trial cardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factor including high blood pressure overwork of cardiac muscle and longterm consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugarall cause increased stress to heart cell individual with diabetes cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipient are also known to be at high risk it almost like building a scar say michalak it exactly the same type of biological activity but it happening in the tissue in the heart it destroys the ability of the heart to function normally heart risk spike after week of sugary drink the team is now pushing forward with additional study to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in human they also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acid can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring we dont yet have a full understandingnobody doesof how the bile acid actually doe what it doe in heart cell explains michalak so another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cell at the molecular level how can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way once that occurs the team hope to work with cardiologist to quickly move the research into clinical trial involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patient if cardiac fibrosis can be stopped then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk say agellon this would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease the canadian institute of health research funded the study which appears in plo one source mcgill university the post bile acid might prevent deadly heart scar appeared first on futurity jul http wwwfuturityorg cardiacfibrosisbileacid,0

cheese or why the french were right the command say cheese is a phrase so commonly used to elicit a smile that today it is understood from the simple imperative cheese but prior to the s such photographic cajolery wa unknown indeed in the preceding victorian era the desirable beauty standard wa considered a tightly pursed orbicularis oris muscle whether because of poor dentition or the prim and proper societal norm of the time or some combination of both smile were only for child peasant and drunk and until very recently the prevailing conventional wisdom for healthy eating relegated consuming cheese to a failing of the ignorant simple or misguided from the late s through the s there wa a mandate from the expert and power that be to consume le fat and particularly saturated fat principally those derived from animal source such a meat poultry and dairy that admonishment ha continued to echo and drive our poor culinary choice over the ensuing halfcentury like an unresolved daddy issue an uncomplicated historical glance would have revealed that a modest living fermented food like real cheese had helped sustain and advance human kind across civilization and across the globe while a large portion of the world population is lactose intolerant and therefore unable to consume or potentially benefit from raw or fresh milk product cheese and particularly aged cheese are an exception the milk sugar or lactose is utilized by beneficial bacteria lactobacillus come to mind along with the fat most of which are saturated and protein and through the process of fermentation raw milk undergoes the transformation from raw milk product to cheese a certain cheese age there is often le lactose present so much so that for many even those who are lactose intolerant and unable to tolerate fresh milk such delicious pillow of probiotic loaded goodness can be enjoyed for the last half century real cheese have been discounted a part of a healthful approach to eating primarily because of their saturated fat and cholesterol content while the mediterranean diet wa promoted a an ideal dietary model the dairy aspect of this gastronomy wa shoved into a corner where it lingered and mouldered often unappreciated is the historical fact that fermented dairy had a long and prominent place in ancient diet such a the mediterranean this is because while fresh milk can be consumed it is quite perishable and much more valuable a a raw material raw milk can be turned into several product like cream butter yogurt kefir whey and cheese all of which have a substantially longer shelf life cheese reemerged from the shadow with the insight gleaned from the french paradox of the s the french who drank wine and consumed butter cream and over different kind of cheese most of which are ohsostinky good all these tasty bit that were verboten in the u at the time had significantly le cardiovascular disease it turn out it wa more than the wine a dietary approach like mediterranean style cuisine rich in natural wholesome and fermented food ha been shown to reduce generalized inflammation and stress oxidative stress and inflammation play major role in the onset and development of the diabetes and it precursor metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of central obesity and at least two of the following four additional factor high triglyceride low hdl or good cholesterol high blood pressure or increased fasting plasma glucose concentration data from the recent european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic study examined healthy and diabetic participant from european nation the researcher found an inverse association between cheese fermented dairy consumption and the incidence of diabetes eating only g d total of cheese and or yogurt wa associated with a reduction in the incidence of type diabetes a new study just released revealed that just g daily of a parmesanlike italian cheese grana padano lowered blood pressure a effectively a the typically prescribed antihypertensive pharmaceutical this occurred even though the cheese contained the equivalent amount of sodium that would be found in consuming a ounce serving of potato chip previous study had isolated some particular tripeptides in certain type of cheese and demonstrated a relationship to being able to lower blood pressure these particular compound are formed through the interaction of human gastrointestinal enzyme and the gut microbiota these peptide complex have angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibiting property such ace inhibitor constitute an important class of medication that not only lower blood pressure but are a foundation of therapy from those suffering from cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure from a variety of cause another study examined almost participant it examined the association between cheese consumption in various age group and circulating concentration of hdl or good cholesterol and triglyceride a negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease the more cheese consumed the higher the hdl and the lower the triglyceride the researcher suggested that this wa the result of the particular fatty acid composition of cheese and it inherent probiotic bacterial content the high protein and probiotic content of cheese is also believed to contribute to it almost neutral effect on plasma cholesterol even though cheese is high in cholesterol and saturated fat like so many other such natural foodstuff it impact on blood lipid and total cholesterol is negligible some kind of cheese namely those infected with penicillium such a roquefort stilton or gorgonzola exhibit high concentration of andrastins a b c and d these are potent inhibitor of the enzyme farnesyltransferase this enzyme play a key role in cholesterol synthesis and it inhibition decrease cholesterol production in fact while the total cholesterol is overall minimally unchanged some study suggest that consuming these type of food shift the cholesterol towards the le inflammatory le atherogenic type an interesting observation arises from these study the decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation marker is independent of body weight eating fat doe not make you fat nor are the benefit simply the result of losing weight or caloric consideration the healthful effect also occur quite rapidly which suggests not just a correlation but a causation oligosaccharide which are also present in cheese are prebiotics this is the food that sustains a healthy gut microbiota it is what feed the wee beasties cheese which contain both prebiotics and probiotic become that gut microbiome superfood a synbiotic another recently completed study demonstrated the cheese consumption directly altered the gut microbiome in an extremely favorable way certain gut bacteria are associated with the production of a compound known a trimethylaminenoxide or tmao the bacteria produce this compound in response to the dietary ingestion of choline level of tmao have been found to correlate and are directly predictive of cardiovascular risk the consumption of cheese rapidly altered the composition of the gut microbiome there wa significantly le tmao produced the positive change to the gut microbiome associated with the regular consumption of such a powerful wholesome naturally fermented synbiotic food a cheese may explain the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease in high cheese consumption country canned smile and canned cheese dont cut it for that unique stinky goodness and real

aka rock bottom hello world im jay bee this is the me against me project blog get ready for runon sentence should you look around youll notice that this isnt the first blog entry for my project but it will be my final attempt a last doover if you will to overcome my many issue while chronicling my journey in an effort to showcase the seriousness of these issue the reality of what binge eating disorder look like that it real the physical repercussion of having bed the confusion of trying to figure out the best way to get healthy the overpowering stress of it all and the sometimes lack of available help to treat and defeat my particular form of mental physical illness see i warned you about runon sentence get ready for more i am completely worn out mentally physically spiritually from my dealing with mental illness for what feel like forever ive tried so many time to get healthy and having ultimately failed every single time another failure will most like result in well let not think of that right now considering how young i am it crazy to think of just how sick weak and old i feel some of the stuff i am dealing with physically doesnt usually occur in people until they are much older and have lived a long life of beating themselves up with poor diet drinking and smoking with my mental health issue and the resulting physical problem that stem from never overcoming those issue i exist within an incredibly dangerous combination of crap perfect for an early death the great list of issue binge eating disorder bed panic disorder kinda like having anxiety problem but this version is constant and relentless in it pursuit to rob you of any sort of peace and happiness you become a distant sort of robot chronic depression when youre happy youre normal when youre sad youre very sad morbidly obese weighing a much a lb massive list of physical issue due to so many year of battling food addiction extreme weight change the constant stress from everything mentioned above type diabetes the only time im happy to settle for not being number one sleep apnea slightly enlarged heart due to the sleep apnea morbid obesity and diabetes high blood pressure constantly dizzy lightheaded highly inflammatory body in the danger zone for heart attack stroke extreme acid reflux weakened and inflamed throat esophagus sinus airway lung from choking on acid in my sleep super fun way to wake up in the middle of the night skin disorder developed from poor diet high sugar in blood psoriasislike vision issue high blood pressure and diabetes are making my vision fade quickly bone joint issue hip popping out randomly tightness everywhere straight neck compressed lower back it all cause lot of numbness inability to move without pain or just not being able to move at all back muscle issue lower back get strained pulled constantly cant move cant walk constantly winded feeling sick im always out of breath and feel dizzy or sick just talking make me winded sometimes flushed face feel hot face always look oddly red and flushed in comparison to the rest of my body around my eye and my face always feel hot and somewhat numb to the touch persistent liver gallbladder pain something is going on in my liver gallbladder pancreas area the area is painful most of the time now and i have symptom of some scary stuff going onhonestly there are probably more issue than that but whatever you get the idea at this point the deck is definitely stacked against me the odds of a full recovery are not in my favor im sure if youre of a more rational and sane mind youre probably thinking how the hell did you let yourself get that sick that fat that unhealthy well thats what make all of this so tricky it the necessary part of bed food addiction which mental health professional still wont officially say exists that make them bonafide mental illness you cant overcome them alone and or you have to reach your own version of rock bottom to truly be able to get better even if you have moment where you can kinda see it like that guy in the predator movie there something in those tree you can try to get healthy lose weight work out but ultimately you fail you usually gain even more weight than before along with new accompanying physical problem that make a sedentary lifestyle feel most comfortable and your bed food addiction gain a much greater hold over you you fall into an even deeper and darker hole and you feel almost powerless to try and overcome yourself your disease i have tried so many time to figure out this puzzle up until almost two year ago there wa virtually no help for someone with binge eating disorder it wa just recently officially recognized a a mental illness important side note doctor can be really dumb so beware if you were going to get any help at all you had to be assigned an illness you didnt actually have they diagnosed me a bulimic even though i told them i never vomit or you had to pay out of pocket for an extremely expensive treatment facility but the chance of that fancy facility accepting male wa virtually zero so if you were a guy with bed you were basically screwed now thing are a little different since bed wa officially claimed a a mental illness there are a couple commercial about bed one of which is specifically trying to sell you some poisoned pill ill get into that another time there a nice website called neda that offer some assistance to those looking to find help for bed though there wa no place near me when i last checked and health insurance ha to accept your claim of being mentally ill now thus provide you with assistance getting help a for me i am at a place where ive finally accepting that i can not in any way overcome my illness without serious help from mental health professional ive actually always known that but until recently i never had a way to get the help that i so desperately needed where i mean im finally accepting that i am helpless is in the following ive been trying to get myself clean by getting on a healthy cleanse diet and overcoming the intense physical withdrawal i feel when i stop eating sugary and badcarb food for me food addiction is no joke i get very sick for nearly a week with some wicked physically mental withdrawal for the last four month each time ive attempted this diet i have failed i have allowed that failure to hold myself back from admitting myself into an eating disorder clinic this is where i am giving in i see that the selfsabotage part of my mind ha been holding me back with this need to get clean before entering treatment it been kind of a convenient excuse for the repetitive bingeinducing diet failure ive been repeating for the last few month now no more prepping for my admittance to treatment tomorrow i will be in contact with an eating disorder clinic to set up my admittance asap so there it is now were all basically on the same page you know exactly what all im dealing with over the next however long it take to get healthy ill be posting daily blog regular vlogs on my youtube channel and random thought update etc on facebook twitter ill include the link to everything on this page so feel free to follow along like subscribe and all that good stuff if you or anyone you know is struggling with binge eating disorder be sure to go to neda to find some helpful info and a free hotline to call a for following along with my project maybe youll discover something that help you find your own way toward getting healthy or at least youll realize that bed and food addiction are both very real and very dangerous im definitely not doing any of this for popularity it actually quite humiliating to share all of this i hope to be an example for the million of people that knowingly or unknowingly struggle with what i have to show how hard it is to exist with bed food addiction mental illness and morbid obesity hopefully my experience and brutal honesty along the way about what im dealing with and going through will help others most importantly this project will show everyone that this isnt a problem that you can fix on your own youll need help to truly recovery from such mental and physical issue it going to take multiple health professional and the assistance of others that are caring and understand youre illness it take a community for me i realize that ill have to piece together that community for myself but at least i still have hope and thats good enough for now feel free to contact me with any question comment or concern together we shall overcome love jay bee facebook page please like

metformincontaining drug drug safety communication revised warning for certain patient with reduced kidney function audience pharmacy nephrology internal medicine patient issue fda is requiring labeling change regarding the recommendation for metformincontaining medicine for diabetes to expand metformin use in certain patient with reduced kidney function the current labeling strongly recommends against use of metformin in some patient whose kidney do not work normally fda wa asked to review numerous medical study regarding the safety of metformin use in patient with mild to moderate impairment in kidney function and to change the measure of kidney function in the metformin drug labeling that is used to determine whether a patient can receive metformin fda concluded from the review of study published in the medical literature that metformin can be used safely in patient with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patient with moderate impairment in kidney function fda is requiring change to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendation on the drug use in patient with mild to moderate kidney impairment fda is also requiring manufacturer to revise the labeling to recommend that the measure of kidney function used to determine whether a patient can receive metformin be changed from one based on a single laboratory parameter blood creatinine concentration to one that provides a better estimate of renal function ie glomerular filtration rate estimating equation egfr this is because in addition to blood creatinine concentration the glomerular filtration rate take into account additional parameter that are important such a the patient age gender race and or weight see the fda drug safety communication for additional information including a data summary and a list of metformincontaining drug background metformincontaining medicine are available by prescription only and are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar level in patient with type diabetes when untreated type diabetes can lead to serious problem including blindness nerve and kidney damage and heart disease metformincontaining medicine are available a singleingredient product and also in combination with other drug used to treat diabetes the current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patient whose kidney do not work normally because use of metformin in these patient can increase the risk of developing a serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis in which too much lactic acid build up in the blood recommendation healthcare professional should follow the latest recommendation when prescribing metformincontaining medicine to patient with impaired kidney function patient should talk to their health care professional if they have any question or concern about taking metformin the labeling recommendation on how and when kidney function is measured in patient receiving metformin will include the following information before starting metformin obtain the patient egfr metformin is contraindicated in patient with an egfr below ml minute m starting metformin in patient with an egfr between ml minute m is not recommended obtain an egfr at least annually in all patient taking metformin in patient at increased risk for the development of renal impairment such a the elderly renal function should be assessed more frequently in patient taking metformin whose egfr later fall below ml minute m as the benefit and risk of continuing treatment discontinue metformin if the patient egfr later fall below ml minute m discontinue metformin at the time of or before an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patient with an egfr between and ml minute m in patient with a history of liver disease alcoholism or heart failure or in patient who will be administered intraarterial iodinated contrast reevaluate egfr hour after the imaging procedure restart metformin if renal function is stable healthcare professional and patient are encouraged to report adverse event or side effect related to the use of these product to the fda

in a close vote a committee of medical expert said today that eteplirsen a drug to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy ha not met the bar set by the fda for approval which could make the drug the third duchenne treatment in recent month to face fda rejection adding to the frustration of a tightknit and increasingly desperate community of patient and their advocate the committee one of many that help the fda evaluate drug for approval wrestled today with a question that in most other circumstance would never even merit consideration should the agency approve a drug based on one trial with just patient but the consideration wa serious because duchenne is a progressive fatal disease with no effective treatment or cure a throng of patient advocate and others more than strong showed up with more than making their case at today hearing in hyattsville md a suburb of washington dc that lasted more than hour even the fda top drug official made a rare appearance at the meeting weighing in with comment just before the vote still nearterm approval of eteplirsen developed by cambridge mabased sarepta therapeutic nasdaq srpt appears unlikely the recommendation of fda advisory panel are not binding but the agency typically side with the expert decision the member panel voted to that sarepta hasnt provided substantial evidence from adequate and wellcontrolled study that eteplirsen help duchenne patient body create enough dystrophinthe muscleprotecting protein they lackto predict a benefit just before the vote janet woodcock the director of the fda center for drug evaluation and research and a key decision maker on drug approval made clear that the matter at hand wa accelerated approval a process that allows the agency to green light drug on a thinner body of evidence the fda final decision due by may will have significant implication for both the drug industry and thousand of patient with duchenne approval risk setting a precedent for allowing drug onto the market with a bare minimum of human testing a rejection mean patient whose disease is a death sentence lose more time before a medicine is available i respect the fda caution in setting a precedent in approving new drug but our kid are not a precedent they are real live human being and they are short on time said debra miller the ceo of the nonprofit newport beach ca organization cureduchenne at the hearing an fda official once told me the worst thing we can do is approve a drug and then have to pull it off the market i argue that the worst thing we can do is deny access to a drug and then find out it workstoo late after we have lost a generation of child the implication of this panel were clear from the start william dunn the director of the agency division of neurology product noted that regardless of how urgently a drug is needed for duchenne the fda would not lower it approval standard nor would it take perverse delight in rejecting a drug he knew what wa coming emotion will run high dunn said child with duchenne their parent doctor and even some politician spoke nearly all pleading for the agency to approve the drug one young patient responding to the agency criticism of eteplirsens effectiveness called the drug amazing and life changing i can only guess you dont know anything about duchenne he said a applause rang out while the panel voted against eteplirsen woodcock comment seemed to leave the door open for more evaluation in devastating disease the consequence of this mistake can be extreme she said but most of these con are borne by the patient that said the agency ha already brushed patient and advocate pressure aside in rejecting two other duchenne drug that were close to approval in january the agency said no to drisapersen a drug from biomarin pharmaceutical nasdaq bmrn a month later it rejected an approval application from ptc therapeutic nasdaq ptct on a drug called ataluren both drisapersen and ataluren are meant to slow the grim march

weekend lighter feel hunger february no feel free to mail your view on this edition of wl to mgwarriergmailcom i first person another view on inequality and hunger on the morning of february a small shop near bhandup railway station caught fire and wa gutted i couldnt go to the newspaper vender a smoke and fire force scared me i missed my usual finance newspaper that morning any calamity is an opportunity that gave me a chance to read the rhetoric of inequality by former procter gamble ceo gurucharan da published in the time of india that day the article give a fair idea about how those who have never been hungry or have forgotten the hungry day look at hunger da claim that carping over inequality tantamount to debating what wa settled long ago you dont make the poor rich by making the rich poor excerpt from the article i have always believed that it is none of my business how much the ambanis earn a long a they create lot of job pay their tax and produce wealth for the society the aam aadmi care mostly about how he is fairing he sometimes compare himself to his friend but never to the filthy rich judging the lifestyle of others tempts one to control other thing and this is a short step to becoming a command society not to live ostentatiously is a call of dharma not a legal duty i am totally brainwashed by gurucharan da and i leave it to you think for yourself for now if i am able to come out of the damage i will be back with my view later ii from here and there february needed higher insurance cover this refers to aarati krishnans article deposit insurance what you didnt know real return february the article brings together in one place several faq on deposit insurance with answer explaining factual position the article will serve a larger purpose if policy maker take cognizance of the constraint within which dicgc is functioning today and initiate move that will help the organisation recast it vision and mission to conform to the present scenario in which bank and financial institution are working in india today such a makeover for dicgc may have to factor in i the resource at dicgcs command at r crore is not small but it is inadequate to meet the business expansion the corporation may have to think of if the confidence deposit insurance should instil among depositor is to be restored dicgc may also have to revisit credit guarantee a function it exited some time back in the changed environment ii since there ha been some effort to professionalise dicgc this need to be taken forward iii the anomalous situation arising from commercial bank meeting the cost of the inefficiency of cooperative bank will have to be rectified iv the corporation should apply it mind a to whether continuing the level of deposit insurance should be retained at a low of r one lakh perhaps the threshold should be raised to a level to provide cover for at least per cent of bank deposit v corporation could consider expanding it ambit to all financial institution regulated by rbi which are accepting deposit from public this may need differential rate of premia and coordination with regulatory and supervisory arm of rbi m g warriermumbai february stop speculating on rbi apropos rbi guv and never ending speculation economic time money banking february one wonder why et should join the speculator it is common knowledge that even in when dr raghuram rajan wa being tipped for the governor position there were other influential contender and an opposing school of economist who were spreading all sort of rumour against dr rajan they were again active during the first half of gossiping about the possibility of a change of guard at mint road post general election it is india good fortune that dr rajan survived the move against him so far world ha acknowledged that the leadership provided by dr rajan in the conduct of rbi affair ha been excellent if india decides and dr rajan accepts on a longer term reappointment this paper should not have a doubt about dr rajans capability to sort out his personal relationship with the university with which he ha had an enduring relationship for the last two decade a any new incumbent governor in rbi take minimum six month to settle down and the workinprogress there now need continuity in leadership goi may not think in term of replacing dr rajan in september and perhaps offer a reappointment for a longer tenure but report like this can help gossipmonger and have some impact on the thought process of economist and medium which can influence economy adversely m g warrier mumbai business standard february bank health worry this refers to sudhir keshav bhaves letter a sinking ship february this could be an example of how transparency in a sensitive business like banking can spread panic the indian banking sector is not in a bad a shape a is being made out by some analyst and external agency major indian commercial bank including sbi have been able to meet all statutory requirement unlike their corporate cotravellers bank are meeting their payment obligation on due date and in the recent past there have been no bank failure in the commercial banking sector in india part of credit for this should go to the vigilant regulator this is not to argue that all is well a regard functioning of commercial bank there is immediate need to restore the health of the banking system impaired mainly by reluctance of big borrower to make timely repayment and heavy burden on public sector bank psbs arising from workload and drain on resource in performance of social responsibility there is no point in arguing now that the overhaul and professionalization of public sector bank psbs should have happened along with bank nationalisation and there should have been regular health check and ongoing correction just a a health checkup doe not change the condition of a person the reclassification of more loan a npa doe not alter a bank ability to change the need of the hour is to support bank to recover their due from borrower who have the capacity to repay infuse professionalism in the bank working and restore the faith in the banking system a private sector bank have failed to perform their responsibility and are not too willing to grow their share in banking business is le than per cent privatising the existing public sector bank is no solution perhaps goi should consider nationalising entire banking business and restructuring the banking system to serve public interest m g warrier mumbai iii self development a suggestion shared by a doctor worth accepting each individual must take note of the three minute why is it important three minute will greatly reduce the number of sudden death often this occurs when a person who still look healthy ha died in the night we hear story of people suddenly die the reason is that when you wake up at night to go to the bathroom it is often done in a rush immediately when stand up the brain lack blood flow why three minute is very important in the middle of the night when you are awakened by the urge to urinate for example ecg pattern can change because getting up suddenly the brain which is anaemic can lead to heart failure due to lack of blood hence always practice three minute which are when waking from sleep lie in bed for the first minute sit in bed for the next minute lower your leg sitting on the edge of the bed for the last minute after three minute you will not have an anaemic brain and heart will not fail reducing the possibility of a fall or sudden death share with family friend loved one it can occur regardless of age young or old sharing is caring if you already know regard this a refresher copied from an email received from vathsala jayaraman exrbites group feb http

a time to exercise reduces risk of day heart failure in a a study show that even a little exercise a day ha clear health benefit chair can kill something could have titled the newspaper of the time the discovery made in epidemiologist jerry morris this scottish researcher studied two type of worker other than london bus driver and collector both were men of similar social environment but the first heart attack suffered far more often than the latter the difference seemed to be that driver spent all day while sitting collector had to move constantly up and down the stair between the two floor of those vehicle after confirming the correlation had been observed he published their finding in the lancet in what is considered the first scientific evidence of the link between disease and physical inactivity since then many other scientific study have confirmed that exercise is good for health but how much is necessary to have benefit in a study published this week a group of swedish researcher after analyzing nearly people aged between and year old ha concluded that more than one hour of moderate exercise or half hour of intense exercise a day can reduce the risk of heart failure by the work which is now published in the journal circulation began in and included people who then did not suffer heart failure the swedish team of scientist found that more active a wa a person the lower their risk of autism this study ha also confirmed that although a greater amount of exercise provides greater benefit even low level of activity can have positive effect in addition to promoting exercise a part of a healthy lifestyle the article author researcher at the university of uppsala consider designing city in which walking or cycling move easy and safe can provide great health benefit the explanation for the benefit of physical activity occur among other thing because during exercise the muscle contract more frequently and power increasing blood flow to the artery this cause subtle change in the autonomic system that control the contraction and relaxation of the blood vessel and eventually reduce the number of resting heart rate lower stress and help to have a heart capable of beating in a wider range all these factor reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in addition exercise ha been associated with a reduction of inflammation which is usually involved in disease such a arteriosclerosis exercise slims little although the link between exercise and health not arouse too many doubt not so with that between sport and thinning a motivation that often drive more people to move the state your artery in the case of moderate exercise if deemed to walk a kilometer consume about calorie a day five kilometer are traveled that would mean an extra intake of about calorie a day while quantity is important a kilo of fat contains about calorie thereby maintaining the usual diet weight loss process would be very slow and may produce demotivation for now it seems that the main method to lose weight and stay healthy one is to reduce the number of calorie consumed in any case a shown by the swedish study confirming previous work even a small amount of exercise that doe not make u sylph can help u be better a study led by chi pang wen national health research institute in taiwan analyzed the physical activity level of taiwan for eight year in this group they found that even people who did just minute of exercise a day were le likely to die in those eight year later and increased their life in three year on average compared to inactive people the article also mentioned that in addition to reducing the risk of heart disease the quarter of an hour of exercise could have avoided one in nine cancer death among those who did not perform any physical activity finally they tried to see if what happened wa that the most active people had overall a healthier lifestyle and it wa not when factor such a drinking alcohol or smoking were separated it wa observed that the benefit of sport for health were still present more information document doseresponse relation of total and leisuretime physical activity to risk of heart failure a prospective cohort study doi circheartfailure source daniel mediavilla http elpaiscom sep mar http planetaveganoblogspotcom unahoradeejercicioaldiareduceelhtml,0

this recently published study analyzes the usefulness of different anthropometric measure to predict cardiovascular mortality the main finding indicate that bmi is the most important index at predicting cardiovascular risk a high amount of lean mass ffmi le than those of physique competitor adversely affect risk profile adiposity is not the only factor that determining the high risk profile observed in high bmi total weight including muscle mass is more important the scientist proposes mechanism that may explain the adverse effect of lean mass primarily the amount of circulating blood that strain the heart causing cardiomegaly and therefore increasing risk of heart failure the full article is worth the read mainly the abstract the discussion and the conclusion full article paywall bypass apr http wwwredditcom r fitness comment gadhv recentstudyfindsleanmassisalsostressfulto limitgadhv,0
sarepta issue statement on advisory committee outcome for use of eteplirsen in the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy cambridge mass business wire sarepta therapeutic inc srpt a developer of innovative rnabased therapeutic today announced that the u food and drug administration fda peripheral and central nervous system advisory committee pcnsc met to review the new drug application nda for eteplirsen a a treatment for duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon skipping the advisory committee voted against the finding of substantial evidence from adequate and well controlled study that show that eteplirsen induces production of dystrophin to a level that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit fda question the advisory committee voted with three abstention against finding substantial evidence based on the clinical result of the single historically controlled study study that eteplirsen is effective for treatment of dmd fda question we would like to thank the hundred of patient and family who participated in the discussion today underscoring the critical unmet need of people living with duchenne said edward kaye md sareptas interim chief executive officer and chief medical officer we appreciated the opportunity to present our data to the advisory committee panel and will continue to work with fda a they complete their review of the eteplirsen nda today more than ever we remain committed to our mission of bringing a treatment to the duchenne community dmd is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death the fda is not bound by the advisory committee recommendation but take it advice into consideration when reviewing new drug and biologic license application in general the prescription drug user fee act pdufa action date for completion of fda review of eteplirsen is may in three additional voting question the panel voted to with one abstention against whether decision to administer the minute walk test v conclusion that the patient could no longer walk were sufficiently objective and free of bias and subjective decisionmaking by patient their caregiver and or health care professional to allow for a valid comparison between patient in study and an external control group fda question the panel voted on the impact of the north star ambulatory assessment with one panel member voting that it strengthened the persuasiveness of the finding in study with five voting that it weakened the persuasiveness and seven voting that it had no effect fda question the panel also voted on the impact of the other test of physical performance eg rise time meter run walk on the persuasiveness of the finding in study with the result of one panel member voting that they strengthened the persuasiveness two voting that they weakened the persuasiveness and ten voting that they had no effect fda question the pcnsc advisory committee recommendation wa based on a review of result from the phase iib clinical program for eteplirsen study and longterm outcome through week from the study openlabel extension study a well a year clinical effectiveness data based on a comparison of patient in study to a historical control group that wa designated a a major amendment to the nda in january about the minute walk test mwt the mwt wa developed a an integrated assessment of cardiac respiratory circulatory and muscular capacity for use in clinical trial of various cardiac and pulmonary condition in recent year the mwt ha been adapted to evaluate functional capacity in neuromuscular disease and ha served a the basis for regulatory approval of a number of drug for rare disease with mean change in the mwt ranging from to meter additionally published data from longitudinal natural history study assessing dystrophinopathy a disease continuum comprised of dmd and becker muscular dystrophy support the utility of the mwt a a clinically meaningful endpoint in dmd these data show that boy with dmd experience a significant decline in walking ability compared to healthy boy over one year suggesting that slowing the loss of walking ability is a major treatment goal about duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is an xlinked rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death one of the most common fatal genetic disorder dmd affect approximately one in every male worldwide a devastating and incurable musclewasting disease dmd is associated with specific error in the gene that code for dystrophin a protein that play a key structural role in muscle fiber function progressive muscle weakness in the lower limb spread to the arm neck and other area eventually increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure the condition is universally fatal and death usually occurs before the age of about eteplirsen eteplirsen is designed to address the underlying cause of dmd by restoring the messenger rna mrna reading frame thus enabling the production of a shorter functional form of the dystrophin protein eteplirsen u sareptas proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholine oligomer pmo chemistry and exonskipping technology to skip exon of the dystrophin gene approximately percent of the dmd population is amenable to exon skipping data from clinical study of eteplirsen in dmd patient have demonstrated a consistent safety and tolerability profile and have also shown measurable dystrophin protein expression promoting the synthesis of a shorter dystrophin protein is intended to slow the decline of ambulation and mobility seen in dmd patient there currently is no approved treatment in the united state for dmd and eteplirsen ha not been approved by the fda or any regulatory authority for the treatment of dmd about sarepta therapeutic sarepta therapeutic is a biopharmaceutical

washington dc april because sequenced care plan called clinical pathway now shape the treatment decision for an increasing number of cancer patient an initiative called project innovation unveiled decoding clinical pathway the first online resource for the public that explains what pathway are and how they affect cancer care today the goal is to help patient understand factor that are shaping their care and if theirs is governed by a pathway so they are better prepared to weigh available treatment option with their physician and care team project innovation is a campaign to elevate advancement in cancer treatment a a national priority coinciding with the publication of the policy paper recommendation for the role of clinical pathway in an era of personalized medicine on april in the american journal of managed care the new module come at a time when the use of pathway is expanding and evolving authored by cancer specialist working with the national patient advocate foundation npaf the paper report that many hospital and physician practice now use pathway to translate published medical practice guideline into the essential step for treating a specific disease or condition when properly designed and implemented these pathway help steer patient and provider to evidencebased treatment option that take into account such factor a efficacy and safety along with cost however the npaf paper caution that pathway can also be oriented more towards cookiecutter approach that can preempt shared decisionmaking between doctor and patient and interfere with physician clinical judgement this is of increasing concern a insurance company implement their own care plan a a way to control cost and in some case pay bonus to doctor for prescribing on pathway treatment the american society of clinical oncology asco estimate that individual health plan are currently implementing oncology pathway particularly for breast lung and colorectal cancer responding to these development the online guide introduces the concept of pathway to patient and caregiver most of whom have never heard the term before and serf a a primer on the purpose of these care plan the likely benefit of patientfocused pathway and the potential limit restrictive version may impose on available treatment option and patient access to emerging personalized therapy the decoding clinical pathway module is available on the project innovation website at wwwprojectinnovationorg for too long the discussion about cancer clinical pathway ha been limited to physician insurance company and policymakers even though patient are directly affected by how these care plan are designed and what they cover said alan balch phd chief executive officer of the patient advocate foundation paf which manages project innovation our goal is to equip patient and caregiver with userfriendly information about pathway so they will know what question to ask and be prepared to weigh treatment option with their oncologist the need for transparency today clinical pathway are used to manage cancer and other challenging disease such a congestive heart failure and diabetes when applied to cancer care these protocol are intended to allow oncologist and patient to weigh treatment regimen based on different safety and effectiveness profile improve outcome and drive value in the health system conversely some pathway erode the doctorpatient relationship and the overall quality of cancer care by limiting or precluding treatment option that may be appropriately personalized to an individual patient which is why the npaf policy paper state patient need to be aware not just of how option on pathway were chosen but also of what other alternative are viable according to guideline that may not be listed in the pathway patient can then have an honest consultation with their physician about the various risk benefit and cost associated with each viable option reflecting this position asco published a policy statement with nine recommendation to improve clinical pathway and the national patient advocate foundation issued a set of guideline for clinical pathway design and development calling for all clinical pathway to support shared decisionmaking and reflect patient preference for how to individualize their care however until these recommendation are enacted the online module encourages patient to take action themselves by asking these question of their oncologist is my treatment determined by a clinical pathway if so what treatment option are available through the pathway for my diagnosis and why were they chosen doe the pathway include the option of enrolling in a clinical trial what happens if the most appropriate treatment is not covered by the pathway are there way that the health plan will cover this treatment doe the insurance plan give financial incentive to the oncology practice for following the pathway further the online module recommends patient and caregiver take advantage of new rule under the affordable care act aca which require insurance company to make available in concise easytounderstand language what their health plan cover way to get information on the drug covered through the health plan are to visit the insurer website to review the list of prescription the plan includes ask the insurance company to provide the summary of benefit and coverage a form that summarizes the key feature of the plan such a the covered benefit costsharing provision and coverage limitation and exception call the insurance company directly to find out what drug are covered about project innovation launched in june and spearheaded by the patient advocate foundation paf and national patient advocate foundation npaf project innovation is a national movement designed to accelerate the pace of medical discovery in cancer deliver safe and effective breakthrough therapy to patient quickly and save life through project innovation and it complementary policy development initiative the cancer innovation coalition stakeholder have joined force to address the barrier slowing the pace of biomedical research and limiting patient access to much needed treatment

another step towards finding best treatment combo for each individual patient eurekalert science newsa service of the american association for the advancement of science public release feb single dose of trastuzumab kick start immune response in certain breast cancer case western reserve university a tumor immune response to a single dose of the her inhibitor trastuzumab predicted which patient with herpositive breast cancer would respond to the drug on a more longterm basis according to the result of a study published recently in clinical cancer research in addition vinay varadan phd assistant professor at case western reserve university school of medicine and member of the case comprehensive cancer center and his colleague found that woman with the herenriched subtype of herpositive breast cancera subtype that is estrogen and progesterone receptor negativehad the highest rate of immune response to treatment with trastuzumab with significant increase in immune response after a single dose of the drug our study showed for the first time that the immunecellactivating property of trastuzumab are likely related to the subtypes of breast cancer varadan said knowing this can inform future trial studying the usefulness of adding immunotherapy drug to trastuzumab only onehalf of woman with herpositive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab will have their tumor completely respond to therapy prior to undergoing surgery to remove the mass even when a second hertargeting drug such a pertuzumab is combined with trastuzumab only of woman have a complete response therefore there is a need to find way to identify woman who are the most likely to respond to this presurgical treatment prior research showed that a patient own immune system can play a role in determining whether the tumor will respond to therapy with trastuzumab to look into this association further varadan and his colleague used data from two clinical trial to measure the molecular makeup of breast tumor after treatment with a single dose of trastuzumab they examined how and if the immune system interacted with the drug and if the immuneassociated property of trastuzumab were related to the subtype of herpositive breast cancer woman with the herenriched subtype of disease had the highest rate of tumor response compared with other disease subtypes in patient taken from both clinical trial based on these result varadan and colleague used a molecular signature immune index to measure the amount of immune activity occurring within the tumor tissue again the herenriched subtype tumor had significant increase in immune activity after only one dose of trastuzumab compared with the other subtypes we found that higher immune index evaluated after just one dose of trastuzumab predicted the tumor response varadan said this response seems to be specific to trastuzumab there wa no association between immune activity and the subtype of breast cancer in patient who were given a single dose of another chemotherapy also the predictive ability of the immune index test wa not observed in patient tumor before any therapy wa given suggesting that just a single dose exposure may be a beneficial way to identify which patient are most likely to benefit from trastuzumabbased chemotherapy and thus do not need additional antiher treatment varadan said finally the researcher wanted to identify which type of immune cell were associated with this brief exposure to trastuzumab they found that signature of tcell activitya key immune responsewere consistently predictive of response after one dose of trastuzumab suggesting that the immune system is likely playing a key role in enabling the therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab specifically pd expression a marker of tcells wa significantly increased in woman with the herenriched subtype of disease this suggests that this subtype of breast cancer may benefit most from the addition of drug that target pd given that the subtypes of herpositive disease and the immune signature predict response to trastuzumabbased therapy the next question is whether these signature can also predict response to dualher targeted therapyvaradan said additionally we would like to understand why certain breast cancer have a strong immune response when treated with antiher therapy while others escape immune surveillance

enough water could help dr christopher calapai do is a manhattan osteopathic physician board certified in family medicine and antiaging medicine he state that there is always the case of too much of a good thing some people are such water drinking devotee that they are aquaholics resulting in overhydration a a result expert now fear weve become so focused on staying hydrated that were guzzling water to lifethreatening extreme dr calapai point out that there are two type of overhydration increased water intake and retaining water increased water intakeor drinking more water than the kidney can get rid of in the urinecan cause too much water to collect in the body when the body is unable to get rid of excess water it is said to be retaining water this happens with several medical condition for instance it can be dangerous because it throw off the balance between water and sodium in the blood overhydration caused by drinking too much water can occur both consciously and unconsciously dr calapai say that a person may drink too much water during exercise some medication can also cause dry mouth and cause an increase in thirst increased thirst can also be caused by uncontrolled diabetes psychiatric condition such a schizophrenia primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia can also cause compulsive water drinking what are the symptom of overhydration symptom of overhydration may not be recognized in the early stage but can include nausea and vomiting headache change in mental state confusion or disorientation if left untreated overhydration can lead to dangerously low level of sodium in the blood hyponatremia this can cause moresevere symptom such a muscle weakness spasm or cramp seizure unconsciousness coma how can overhydration be prevented endurance athlete can reduce the risk of overhydration by weighing themselves before and after a race to determine how much water they have lost and need to replenish dr calapai emphasizes that individual should avoid drinking more than one liter per hour of fluid drinking more fluid before and during a race or anintensive athletic exertion can also help you avoid the need to drink too much water afterwards sport beverage that contain the electrolyte sodium and potassium are also recommended a both are lost in sweat so how do you know how much water you need for starter dont rely solely on thirst say calapai a soon a you put water on your tongue you kill your thirst mechanism instead he suggests the following weigh yourself daily for a week to check hydration your body weight shouldnt fluctuate too much calapai say notice how much you peeand it colorin the morning it should be a copious amount and pale or clear aim to wake feeling hydrated if youre thirsty when you get out of bed in the morning you may not be consuming enough fluid when choosing sport drink search for label with low sugar dr calapai recommends about gram per ounce serving even natural drink like coconut water have too much sugar and potassium to hydrate coffee tea and watery fruit and vegetable count toward fluid intake also caffeine is not a diuretic dr calapai say it about volume so if you drink five cup youll pee more start slowly sleep is a six to eighthour fast so if you drink three cup of juice or water right away youll trigger the volume response sip instead if you have an underlying medical condition such a diabetes congestive heart failure or kidney problem talk to your doctor about the best treatment for those condition if you experience excessive thirst or an overly strong urge to drink water contact your doctor before you develop symptomsit could indicate a medical problem that requires treatment dr christopher calapai do antiaging physician and the stem cell guru

this monthly blog highlight and discus emerging trend and challenge related to healthcare data and it ever changing life cycle by wendy james rhia pmp the technological advance that have taken place over the past year have been nothing short of phenomenal when i reflect on the thing i have experienced not only in my professional career but the technological advance i have seen over the course of my life across the board in all facet of life the effect is staggering from safetyoriented upgrade we now take for granted like lap seatbelt and car equipped with airbags to the improbably yet amazingly real home monitoring system that notifies me whenever there is anything out of the norm from climate control to movement at the front door think about it who would have ever guessed this would be the type of environment we would live in today technology ha also been advancing in the healthcare industry suppose someone very close to you just had a major health event and ha been admitted to the hospital a health information management professional that are in the business so to speak it could be said we are at a slight advantage to know that being admitted to the hospital may not result always in the best outcome and are on the lookout for potential issue whether we like to think it or not we know what can and sometimes doe happen for those who are not a informed an incredible amount of trust and faith is given to those who are now caring for your loved one when i think about those who are not familiar with healthcare i get concerned because many time they do not have an advocate that is independent of those caregiver take for example someone diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which not only present itself a a more enlarged heart on a scan but also is somewhat of an irregular heartbeat when this person present in the emergency room if there is no one there a an advocate for this person this person might receive medication because their blood pressure is not normal these medication then cause the patient to hallucinate which then might cause a misdiagnosis by the caregiver who are unfamiliar with this person a patient best defense is many time a loved one who remains diligent and passionate asking question each step of the way on the journey through the hospitalization what may be normal for your loved one is not normal for someone else so how can our health information actually save a life how many time have you entered in your demographic in triplicate during the same episode of care for the same facility we document our medication we document our date of birth we document our health history we document our allergy we document our past surgery we document our known problem but who really read it to the caregiver it just data but to me or my loved one it my health story one that i am passionate about one that i want to protect not every patient is going to have an advocate available to them at all time while in the hospital for those who do they are lucky there have been many time having that loved one in the room with you might have saved your life perhaps they questioned a medicine or questioned why a certain procedure wa necessary one of the challenge today patient face is the general lack of continuity of care limited knowledge of the patient history or the robotic response to automated and or scheduled order without consideration of the current condition having an advocate present is sometimes nothing short of being a lifesaver the ability to provide such an ardent advocate for each patient is not currently possible or feasible but what if it wa a new smart phone application developed by larry trach at emrconnect is currently being tested that will provide a giant step forward in helping a patient safely navigate a hospital stay this application will monitor data stream from the hospital electronic health record from three different subject area registration and admit discharge transfer adt message provider access of your patient record clinical result like lab vital sign and other pertinent documentation registration and adt monitoring after registration is completed you will be able to visually verify your demographic information guarantor and emergency contact insurance information advance directive and provider assigned to your case a registration system is susceptible to human and interface error such a registration overlay bad medical record or account combine and system interface error if any of your key demographic change during the course of your stay you would be immediately alerted monitoring provider access not all damage or injury is a result of medical malpractice inappropriate access to your health information by someone who is not on your care team can be a signal for identify theft loss of confidentiality and more you will be able to see all the provider that accessed your record what their role wa and what they did on your behalf if you question a particular activity or access a review request can be sent directly to the designated privacy officer or security team clinical monitoring for predicting harmful condition vital sign and lab can be good predictor of vital stress over sedation early detection of sepsis and many other condition or adverse event each time a new result arrives it will be reviewed scored and combined with other key measure risk factor and comorbidities because of the dynamic and sometimes chaotic nature of activity on the nursing unit it is easy to miss a key piece of new information such a a critical lab value not to mention the latency between time of care and time of documentation the monitoring application would allow a patient or the patient designee to receive message about their healthcare there would be remote access for monitoring and message capability thus improving communication among all of the appropriate caregiver if we can wire our home to provide u with uptotheminute information in the interest of safety and security then we should certainly be able to apply this same technology to healthcare after all there is nothing more important than saving a life wendy james wsjyahoocom is a

mostly affecting adolescent and young adult the preclinical study will be conducted by nida beginning in the summer of utilizing a wellcharacterized animal model initial result of the focused study are anticipated in late or early we believe that ryanodex ha the potential to provide benefit to patient experiencing pathological thermal dysregulation associated with the use of ecstasy and methamphetamine we are very pleased to be working alongside the nih to explore the potential of ryanodex to reduce elevated body and brain temperature resulting from the use of ecstasy and methamphetamine result of our recently completed clinical study of ryanodex for exertional heat stroke indicated that patient receiving ryanodex in addition to standard of care soc which is currently limited to body cooling and supportive measure experienced an incremental therapeutic benefit over patient receiving soc only said scott tarriff president and chief executive officer of eagle pharmaceutical we believe that ryanodex ha the potential to provide benefit to patient experiencing pathological thermal dysregulation associated with the use of ecstasy and methamphetamine stated adrian hepner executive vice president and chief medical officer we anticipate that having positive outcome from our preclinical study would enable u to meet with fda and potentially lead to a rapid transition into pivotal clinical trial clinical study in emergency setting are of relatively short duration due to the nature of the disorder and the known distribution of case of ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication commonly associated with large holiday celebration the development of ryanodex for body and brain hyperthermia associated with intoxication from illicit psychostimulant

chalk and ice is an extremely addictive stimulant drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine it take the form of a white odorless bittertasting crystalline powder methamphetamine increase the amount of dopamine in the brain dopamine is involved in reward motivation the experience of pleasure and motor function methamphetamine ability to release dopamine rapidly in reward region of the brain produce the euphoric rush or flash that many user experience repeated methamphetamine use can easily lead to addiction the consequence of methamphetamine abuse can cause memory loss aggression psychotic behavior damage to the cardiovascular system malnutrition and severe dental problem methamphetamine abuse ha also been shown to contribute to increased transmission of infectious disease such a hepatitis and hiv aid methamphetamine is classified a a schedule ii drug available only through a prescription that cannot be refilled according to data from the national survey on drug use and

hi there are no specific remedy to improve breathlessness after an acute heart attack what we should do is look for the cause of this problem and propose a targeted treatment first it is important to explain what it mean myocardial infarction myocardial infarction also known a heart attack is when a piece of the heart is destroyed once destroyed that area will no longer contraction function and the rest of the heart will have to work more to address the lack of that piece when this piece destroyed is bigger cause larger contraction deficit including severe heart dysfunction and can cause death of patient second when there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of it ability to pump blood forward and liquid become accumulated in various part of the body especially the lung causing pulmonary edema this fluid accumulation in the lung is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness then i believe the heart attack you had may have destroyed a large area in your heart leading to a condition known a heart failure and there are several treatment for this problem incuindo cardiopulmonary rehabilitation medication and visit by multidisciplinary team i suggest you contact your cardiologist for further information and determine which therapy are needed to solve the problem hope i have answered your question if you have any further question i will be happy to help you wish you good health mar http wwwhealthcaremagiccom question suggestremedyfordifficultyinbreathingandpaininshoulderpostheartattacktreatment answer,0

re ex scientology humanitarian society originally posted by winston smith hi i have been gone so long i forgot how to start a thread this post ha nothing to do with this subject matter just something i discovered somewhere there is a thread talking about the evil of statin med like lipitor and crestor for managing high cholesterol my cholesterol is ok but my cardiologist want me to take lipitor anyway year ago i remember the post about how bad these drug are so i have limited my intake of it without my cardiologist knowledge anyway i have had congestive heart failure for year among many other ill which the oldtimer here know a part of managing congestive heart failure i take lasix which is a diuretic since stopping curtailing the lipitor i have not had to take lasix in quite some time the edema fluid buildup in my leg ha lessened to the point i dont need it the only explanation i have is the lack of lipitor in my system thank you for allowing me to derail this thread and i apologize if it were not for the previous discussion about statin i would still be having a heck of a time with too much fluid buildup i may not be back to see reply but i may who know winnie hey winnie nice to see youre back i dont want to add to the derail therefore only so much in february my heart basically ripped itself apart and i wa dead literally after several month in hospital which included an open heart surgery i am back amongst the living for now based on that experience may i ask you to please take the medication your doctor prescribe the best thing in life are free if you cant dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bull w c field if scientology is a triumph of the will then esmb is a triumph of the wont helluvahoax the most effective tech is let scientology be scientology in front of witness zinjifar experience is what you get when you dont get what you want unknown disclaimer ive never been in scientology or in any other cult im just a critic jul http wwwforumexscnnet showthreadphppostcount,1

being disadvantaged is never an advantage i liken it to someone who ha a handicap sticker on their car and get to park in a closer spot to the store than someone who doe not have a sticker people get mad because they have to walk five minute more than the person who ha the sticker god forbid the person get out of the car and can actually walk and is not in a wheelchair the other person feel like hey thats not fair you can walk just like i can walk you need to park in the back too what they dont realize is that that person may have been in physical therapy for year to be able to walk ok or maybe that person ha a problem like m or congestive heart failure that make them look fine at that moment but by they get home they can barely breathe or move and thats why they were given a sticker is it really worth having a whole life of hardship just to gain what some people feel like is an advantage in one small aspect of life people should ask themselves would i want to trade place with this person for this one little benefit in life that this other person ha the perception that adcoms are easier on this person because of race economics disability etc if the answer is no then stop it sometimes on the outside people look ok but you really dont know the thing that they had to go through to get to that point im not talking about just race that ha to be taken into consideration everyone didnt start off at the same place may http forumsstudentdoctornet thread isbeingdisadvantagedactuallyanadvantage post,1

quote originally posted by mysticphd okay let test this what would your reaction be to the idea that the artificial construct and operation in mathematics manipulating various measure of our reality can serve a abstract clue to the underlying composition of reality itself not just a predictive model of other measurable phenomenon typically user of mathematics seldom consider the philosophical implication of the formula a index of the actual underlying composition of reality a an example of what i am referring to the twin but distinct formula emc and ehf have different u and different unit of measurement etc but they represent a manifestation of the underlying unified field that comprises our reality the field manifestation we call energy mass momentum depending upon the application they are used and measured in are essentially equivalent a einstein revealed do you think we can draw any conclusion about the underlying composition of our reality from them quote originally posted by mitchellmckain my reaction is to tell you i am not a logical positivist whose program to divorce scientific language from metaphysical concept wa a failure metaphysics the study of reality is not something conducted by a scientific methodology and is therefore not science by the modern definition however science cannot be isolated from the metaphysical and epistemological foundation upon which it wa derived this only go to say that science doe not and cannot hold itself up by it own bootstrap not that either of these philosophical endeavor share in the accepted epistemological superiority of science nevertheless science requires such philosophical groundwork and generally relegates such effort to a creative interlude given name like scientific visualization i understand your clarification of your position it is encouraging quote i guess i am straying a little from your question so perhaps more to the point i should say this while science is defined by a very restrictive methodology philosophy is much le restrictive and religion ha no general defined methodology at all the result is not only considerably more diversity of opinion in philosophy and religion but also while religion and philosophy for the most part a well cannot inform science the opposite is not the case science certainly can and doe inform both philosophy and religion i guess in summation i am saying yes to your question it can but this doe not impart a scientific status to these philosophical and religious conclusion good we agree quote i dont know why you claim such a thing this ha certainly never applied to me and it seems to me that scientist do this quite frequently what is true is that they know the difference between such speculation and proper science perhaps it wa more strongly worded than i intended my experience is they typically know the difference but have no interest or desire to even engage the speculation seeing no practical relevance in them although many simply see the artificial construct a model of quantitative representation of process and phenomenon not a indicator of any underlying composition of reality quote of course i do i mean this is something that i do but while many might see a unified field a the underlying reality i think the evidence is greater for underlying reality to be something more of a geometrical nature for example general relativity pretty much reduces gravitational field to the geometry of spacetime kaluza and klein showed that this can include electromagnetism by simply extending gr to dimension string theory m theory reduces all the different particle ie field to the vibrational mode string and higher dimensional branes the geometry of spacetime is fraught with complication that arise from the very nature of our thought and the quantum formation time that underpins our delayed experience of our instantaneous awareness that creates the phenomenon of spacetime we can touch on that later it is true that multidimensional speculation provide the advantage of increasing degree of freedom to represent reality but i am a lover of a fourdimensional world or a minkowski called it die vierdimenionsale velt once we start speculating beyond those dimension almost anything can be represented string theory ha the vibratory nature of reality down but they create a virtual impossibility to ever empirically test their formulation we can only really measure in four dimension quote of course there is always the possibility that what we have is two complementary representation of the same thing this often implies that reality is other than what we visualize and the closest we can get is two different image which only partially capture the reality of the thing you know like how photon electron and such are both particle and wave at the same time yes they are complementary representation that reveal that our underlying reality is actually nothing more than vibratory manifestation of a field this along with quantum mechanic seems to suggest that particle are simply event we measure and not actual material substance existing through time this ha unsettling implication for our macro experience a well it would seem even we are merely vibratory event existing a some manner of aggregate spherical standing waveform whose permanence is illusory i am pleased that we do seem to be on a similar wavelength to egregiously punish a pun quote p emc and ehf do not in of themselves have different unit but any equation can used in different unit if you so choose the dimension remain the same but the unit or measuring yardstick you use is arbitrary and can thus be altered i agree but that is ancillary to the point i wanted to make using them a index of the composition of our reality jun http

yes people are right beta blocker have been relegated to second line therapy when they as drug tehy look at a number of thing the most obvious is how effective they are and side effect but they also look at what they call endpoint these include the adverse health effect of high blood pressure like stroke heart attack kidney failure heart failure and of course death so a drug might lower the bp but have no effect on the endpoint generally drug like ccbs ace inhibitor arb and some diuretic tend to have much more of an effect on preventing or even treating some of these endpoint ccbs are best when hypertension is due to arterial resistance due to stiffness of the arterial wall which naturally increase with age and is more common in afro caribeans there are other issue about the way the drug work or how they might be combined that also influence the drs choice hope this make sense jul http wwwpatientcouk forum discus ccbsorderlatest,0

every time we pray the lord prayer most of u say forgive u our trespass a we forgive those who trespass against u this however is not what matthew actually say there we read forgive u our debt a we have forgiven our debtor in matthew jesus explains that if we forgive the trespass of others ours will be forgiven but if we do not forgive the trespass of others then ours will not be forgiven in luke the word used is sin a jesus probably did not speak in greek all of the new testament is a translation of the aramaic which he would have spoken and in jewish thought of his time debt trespass and sin were interchangeable concept their meaning would overlap i think that english doe provide u some interesting depth though today mp gospel is from a section on forgiveness in mt it begin with how to confront those who have sinned and then go on to say that when two or three gather in jesus name he is with them for many christian this is a very uncomfortable word from the lord because he say that the church human are an extension of god in other word there is no simple division between god and man a is so popular among many jesus say in other place a well that when we are in him our word and action carry the divine imprimatur and convey the power and authority of god jesus take the church very very seriously our reading today begin in verse where peter asks how many time must we forgive seven time this is a biblical number and conveys the idea of generous mercy however jesus ups the ante considerably the greek can be translated a seventy time seven or seventy seven there is probably a reference here to genesis if cain is avenged seven fold truly lamech seventyseven fold and make clear that we a jesus people are in the mercy and forgiveness business the lord then illustrates the principle with a parable a man is in debt owing ten thousand talent one talent is about six to ten thousand denarii a denarii is a day wage so it is at least six thousand day wage or about seventeen year wage multiply that by ten thousand and you have many many lifetime of debt it is totally unpayable the equivalent of a billion dollar for u so the man is to be sold into slavery and his family a well however after begging for mercy and making the ridiculous promise to pay it back if given time the man receives gracious kindness and the master writes off the debt then the same man bump into someone who owes him one hundred day wage just over three month however he ignores the plea for mercy and imprisons his debtor in the end other servant distressed by his cruelty go to the master and inform him of this turn of event so the master confronts the man and point out the mercy which he received the lack of mercy he demonstrated and the punishment he receives what he gave the other prison in english the word sin and trespass are negative they refer to an act which transgresses debt on the other hand ha a broader meaning a debt is something owed sin focused western christian can be so sin aware that we are at risk to overlook the blessing for which we are also indebted to god we also have an unpayable debt of gratitude too often people view their minor sin a unworthy of a death sentence even if god is perfect it doe not resonate that he cannot bear to be in the presence of flawed humanity perhaps if that is how you think it is easier to imagine god problem with people who are so far in debt for blessing a well a sin not being grateful and graceful to others let ponder every breath is a gift hundred of gift each hour day after day if you dont believe it ask someone with copd or asthma or lung disease every breath a gift a debt each heart beat is a gift sending life sustaining blood throughout our body hundred of heart beat a day day after day if you dont believe ask someone unable to walk because of congestive heart failure or other heart disease every beat of your heart a gift a debt is seeing a blessing yes the debt of eyesight is hearing a blessing yes every sound a blessing a debt is beauty around you a blessing yes and each beautiful thing a blessing a debt what of love acceptance laughter companionship every act of kindness we receive any good thing which enriches u each moment and every blessing another debt food and drink rest and sleep painless moment and pleasureseach one every second it last a blessing a wonderful gift and another debt even if i were sinless and could stand before god in righteousness my debt would remain unpayable because all that i am and all that i have is a gift existence is a gift thinking and feeling and being all gift what is my debt million of heart beat and breath thousand of sunlit day and gentle breeze glorious rain and sparkling star hundred of loved one to share my life journey memory of day gone by good day and ask those whose memory are gone what a blessing memory ismore debt yes i owe god billion and billion many blessing blessing i take for granted blessing which i assume i should have everything i have i owe to god all thing and he writes it all off every debt every good thing he ha done and every bad thing i have done written off except say jesus except a we pray except unforgiveness except the refusal to give mercy a we receive it except the rejection of his life in u the one debt that must be paid by u is treating others with love and mercy unforgiveness cancel his gracious mercy so say jesus we are all debtor debtor beyond imagining treat others debtor a god the father ha treated you forgive them their debt forgive a you have been

heart attack also known a a cardiac infarct coronary occlusion coronary thrombosis or acute myocardial infarction is the most serious form of heart disease it is common for person suddenly affected to drop dead during their normal activity it is essential that you be aware of the symptom of a sudden heart attack today modern treatment is very effective the sooner this is started the greater are the chance of complete recovery the symptom of a heart attack are wellestablished the underlying cause of heart disease have been welldocumented and the way of reducing a heart attack are clearcut and wellestablished much research ha given many answer sensible people will follow the straightforward recommendation offered these are set out at the end of this section it is essential to recognize and provide emergency first aid treatment for a possible heart attack heart attack symptom here are the key heart attack symptom a set out by the national heart foundation a prolonged oppressive pain or unusual discomfort in the centre of the chest behind the breastbone the pain may radiate to the shoulder arm neck or jaw often the pain or discomfort is accompanied by sweating nausea vomiting and shortness of breath may occur sometimes the symptom subside then recur never forget a chest pain that doe not go away after minute of rest should never be ignored it could be a heart attack what to do in the case of a heart attack take immediate action make patient comfortable if conscious sit the person up allay anxiety speak encouraging word call ambulance if possible suggest it may be a heart attack and a special coronarycare ambulance may be available if patient collapse breathing stop or heart stop expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression must be started if no assistance is available get the patient to the nearest hospital a urgently a possible time may mean a life saved the quicker the patient receives expert attention the more likely are the chance of survival and complete recovery they reduce with the passage of time and no help do not be embarrassed about seeking help it is better to be wrong than make an error of judgment keep calm do not panic a life could depend on your prompt efficient calm manner the symptom of an infarction are extremely variable according to the size of the infarct some are major and can produce sudden death but the majority are smaller and produce a varying range of symptom attack are not necessarily related to exercise a angina is indeed attack may come on while at rest or even during sleep however usually symptom and sign are fairly typical and allow a doctor to make a prompt diagnosis indeed a person affected can often form an accurate diagnosis an important rule of thumb is that it is better to inaccurately selfdiagnose a heart attack than miss it early diagnosis and prompt treatment may be lifesaving no age group is immune from cardiac infarct however they are far more common in male aged year male outnumber female by to it seems that increasing number of younger male are being afflicted with coronary this may be related to the added stress of modern living although others deny this the high level of living with an increase in fat content of food there is a greater cholesterol intake and other factor in recent year the importance of smoking a a cause of heart disease ha become recognized it is now well documented a a leading cause of this disability although the heart may have suffered relatively minor muscle damage the chance of severe and usually fatal change in heart rhythm are about time greater during the first four hour than during the next many heartattack patient believe they have indigestion colic dyspepsia or some other trivial stomach upset many feel embarrassed to make a fuss or summon assistance fearing they are wrong in their belief others deliberately neglect to call help fearing the worst but hoping their inner fear may be wrong each year more than american die from heart attack and disease of the cardiovascular system ie heart and blood vessel system prompt expert treatment can radically reduce a disastrous outcome indeed it is believed that with proper attention per cent of heartattack patient recover and can return to a nearnormal life again heart attack treatment a heart attack is a medical emergency if a person ha any of the symptom enumerated it is imperative to obtain immediate expert medical assistance there is no place for home remedy in these case apart from allaying the anxiety of the patient and making him or her feel more comfortable taking an aspirin can help while awaiting this attention if sudden collapse occurs and the heart stop beating expiredair resuscitation and external cardiac compression will help maintain breathing and circulation if you have had some basic training in this field it is worth commencing and may be lifesaving call an ambulance at once and briefly explain the nature of the symptom if the ambulance is not available get the patient to the nearest hospital a a matter of urgency special mobile intensivecare ambulance fitted to meet cardiac emergency and equipped with highly trained team called paramedic unit are now available in most capital city in australia and new zealand they can often be at the patient side within a few minute and so can initiate lifesaving treatment within only a few moment immediately emergency care ha been administered the patient is then transported to the special coronary care ward or intensive care unit of a major hospital here highly skilled and very specialized treatment with constant supervision is available the patient is usually attached to a constant electrocardiograph machine and a screen reveals a continuous picture of the heart action the relevant test that are needed are carried out quickly treatment is maintained at a high level of efficiency a prompt and accurate diagnosis is made modern test that seek certain chemical called enzyme in the blood assist the expert in pinpointing an accurate diagnosis these are called cardiac enzyme their presence can tell the extent of the heart attack subsequent serial test indicate the progress of the patient death from a coronary is usually due to the failure of the heart to continue pumping adequately or to a breakdown in the nervous control of the heart which lead to a serious condition called ventricular fibrillation newer drug that assist in bringing this condition back to normal are now being used the drug lignocaine xylocaine assist in reinstating a normal heartbeat a large family of medication called the betablockers can also assist in gross heartbeat irregularity a machine called a defibrillator can also help reestablish normal heartbeat activity painrelieving preparation such a morphine oxygen sedation and the medication that have stood the test of time are still widely used for infarct reassurance and supportive measure are a important today a in earlier day when facility for emergency treatment were far le sophisticated than they are now act promptly study have shown that it take the average heart attack victim three hour to do anything about his symptom the average timelapse between the onset of warning symptom and hospital admission is eight hour the first four hour are of paramount importance the earlier a heart attack patient can be admitted to hospital and get expert attention the greater are the chance of survival there are many general measure that the anginal patient can carry out and which may effectively assist in keeping symptom at a minimum level avoiding the known precipitating factor will help immeasurably the patient should make an effort to avoid undue exercise that is known to produce symptom similarly social and environmental predisposing factor must be avoided it is best to avoid circumstance where emotional crisis and flaring temper are involved for this will only breed more and greater problem if allowed to persist it would be best if the patient could adopt a philosophical attitude to life in general accept the position and make the most of the remaining year of life meal of moderate size and easily digestible food preferably low fat in content and free from fried food are best if there is obvious overweight sticking to a kj calorie aday diet for a while will help lower the weight and so diminish the risk factor regular sleep often assist eight hour a night is preferable sometimes with carp onset of the symptom a period of bed rest may be advisable gearing

a diagram showing how a stem cell in bone marrow becomes different type of blood cell click for credit in a speech john kerry complained about the bush administration saying nothing illustrates this administration antiscience attitude better than george bush cynical decision to limit research on embryonic stem cell during the heat of the stem cell war this wa a common refrain lifesaving treatment could be produced with embryonic stem cell and anyone who questioned whether or not it wa morally acceptable to destroy one life in order to experiment with saving another wa antiscience never mind that there are stem cell in everyones body commonly called adult stem cell and those stem cell also have the potential to cure illness everyone knew that using embryonic stem cell would be better whats the difference between embryonic stem cell and adult stem cell well most of the cell in your body have specific task your skin cell perform one set of task while your muscle cell perform another set of task your liver cell another set of task etc etc these cell have all specialized so they can perform their task efficiently a stem cell by contrast is a cell that hasnt yet specialized it can develop into many different cell depending on your body need embryonic stem cell end up developing into all the cell that make up the body so they are thought to be very very flexible when it come to what they can develop into however to get those stem cell you have to kill the embryo adult stem cell on the other hand have already specialized to some degree for example the drawing at the top of this post show how an adult stem cell found in bone marrow can develop into various different blood cell while that show some serious flexibility bone marrow stem cell dont normally develop into wildly different cell like skin cell a a result it is thought that adult stem cell arent a flexible a embryonic stem cell on the positive side however you dont have to kill anything to get adult stem cell the scientific question then boil down to this is it worth working with stem cell that might not be a flexible a embryonic stem cell in order to avoid killing human embryo those who answered that question with a yes have been routinely labelled antiscience however now that we are year past mr kerrys speech we can see that adult stem cell have in fact demonstrated success in treating a wide variety of illness obviously a lot more research ha to be done and none of these treatment are standard or routine yet nevertheless it is now clear that if there is a limit to the ability of adult stem cell when it come to treating illness we havent reached it yet that brings me to the reason i am writing this article over the past few day i have seen two more example of adult stem cell successfully treating illness the first example appears in jama neurology a specialized publication of the journal of the american medical association this study dealt with the treatment of myasthenia gravis a degenerative neuromuscular disorder that can be lifethreatening the author of the study followed patient that were treated with stem cell from their own bone marrow and all of them achieved stable remission and were freed from ongoing myasthenia gravis therapy now of course this is a small study and while some patient were followed for year others were followed for only year in addition the author note that specialized patient care is necessary for this treatment to be effective a a result they only recommend it for institution that have experience treating patient with myasthenia gravis nevertheless it at least show the potential of using a patient own adult stem cell to treat a neuromuscular disorder the other study isnt a groundbreaking but it doe provide new insight into the use of adult stem cell to treat heart failure the author reported on a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study of endstage patient with serious heart failure the only hope such patient have is for a heart transplant since that wasnt possible for these patient they agreed to be part of a study that examined the efficacy of treating their heart failure with once again stem cell from their own bone marrow the procedure typically took only two hour and most patient were released from the hospital the day after the procedure wa done after month those who received the treatment were le likely to have been taken to a hospital and le likely to die than those who received a placebo while those number arent a wonderful a the number in the myasthenia gravis study they are significant in addition the study wa the largest ever done on this kind of treatment thus it clearly show that patient who need a heart transplant have at least one other option thanks to adult stem cell far from being antiscience then caution about using embryonic stem cell is scientifically reasonable adult stem cell have shown quite a lot of promise and they avoid the moral problem associated with killing embryo reference adam bryant et al myasthenia gravis treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation jama neurology doi jamaneurol return to text dr amit n patel et al ixmyelocelt for

undoubtedly a cigarette is more unhealthy than a soda we all know this thats not the point the point is that a soda creates the same kind of problem a cigarette doe just with lesser intensity cancer is worse than obesity but heart failure and diabetes are not necessarily worse than cancer and theyre a direct result of obesity you can say cigarette are worse than soda and you would be right but that doe not draw an ideological reason to oppose soda tax while supporting cigarette tax if you oppose one for being regressive well theyre both regressive if you oppose one because it worse than the other well whats the line on behavior we can or cant tax we also tax alcohol is that wrong there no strong ideological divide between taxing soda and taxing cigarette except that one is more bad which is not a consistent policy stance at all apr http wwwredditcom r politicaldiscussion comment gdysu whatisyouropiniononsintaxes limitdgzkgy,0

study are increasingly hailing the potential health benefit of moderate alcohol consumption particularly when it come to the heart and lifespan but new research suggests many of these study are flawed and that such benefit may be largely overestimated the researcher say we should be skeptical of study reporting the health benefit of moderate drinking lead researcher tim stockwell phd of the centre for addiction research at the university of victoria canada and colleague reached their conclusion by analyzing study that assessed the effect of moderate drinking on longevity they recently published their finding in the journal of study on alcohol and drug according to the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa over the past month around of adult report engaging in binge drinking and around report engaging in heavy drinking such drinking habit can increase the risk of alcohol use disorder which affect around million adult and adolescent in the u on the other hand numerous study have suggested that in moderation alcohol may be good for u a recent study reported by medical news today for example suggested moderate drinking defined in the study a three to five alcoholic beverage a week may lower the risk of heart attack and heart failure however the new research from stockwell and colleague suggests the result of such study should not be taken at face value after finding that many of them are subject to bias that when accounted for eliminate the reported health benefit of moderate drinking there are many reason to be skeptical from analyzing study that looked at the effect of alcohol consumption on death from all cause the team identified a number of flaw in the way the study were designed one major issue they found wa how the study defined abstainer people who do not drink alcohol the researcher explain that many of the study compared moderate drinker which they define a individual who consume up to two alcoholic beverage daily with current abstainer but these abstainer may include individual of poor health who have stopped drinking a fundamental question is who are these moderate drinker being compared against say stockwell in their analysis the researcher found that only of the study they assessed avoided bias in the abstainer group and these study demonstrated no mortality benefit with moderate drinking furthermore when the researcher accounted for this bias and other flaw they identified related to study design they found that moderate drinker no longer showed any mortality benefit additionally the researcher found that it wa occasional drinker defined a individual who consume le than one alcoholic beverage a week who had the longest lifespan and the team say it is unlikely that alcohol is the reason for this those people would be getting a biologically insignificant dose of alcohol note stockwell the team point out that the research did not investigate how specific type of alcohol such a red wine largely hailed for it health benefit when consumed in moderation wa associated with longevity but stockwell say it is doubtful any health benefit would be down to the alcohol itself overall the team belief their result suggest study hailing the health benefit of moderate drinking should be viewed with caution stockwell say there a general idea out there that alcohol is good for u because thats what you hear reported all the time but there are many reason to be skeptical mar http wwwmedicalnewstodaycom article php,0

breakthrough cholesterol drug fizzle amid price pushback the associated press posted pm edt updated pm edt washington gtgt when a powerful pair of cholesterollowering drug first hit the market last summer initial excitement in the medical community quickly turned to panic the new drug promised to reduce arteryclogging cholesterol by nearly twice a much a older one but they came at an eyepopping price more than per year compared with roughly for the standard drug some expert predicted a doomsday scenario in which the two injectable drug repatha and praluent would add a staggering billion to the u drug bill a doctor signed up million of patient with elevated cholesterol but then something unexpected happened not much caught between skeptical doctor and costconscious insurer the drug have barely sold sanofi reported a meager million from praluent in the last quarter which it comarkets with regeneron pharmaceutical amgen inc declined to break out repatha sale spending on pricey specialty drug ha doubled over the last five year to billion contributing percent of the growth in u medication spending since according to ims health but the startlingly slow launch of praluent and repatha suggests insurer may have found their own formula for fighting back proofofeffectiveness requirement and rigorous paperwork that limit how many patient ultimately receive highcost drug expert see an escalating feud between drugmakers and insurer with little relief in sight advertisement the company think that their drug is going to save a lot of life and payer tend to be skeptical of those claim somewhere in the middle is the truth say professor darius lakdawalla of the university of southern california generally speaking insurer only cover the cost of the new drug for patient with extremelyhigh cholesterol caused by genetic disorder or those with a history of heart problem and elevated cholesterol the insurance paperwork can run several page and often requires a detailed history of past treatment caught in the middle of the coverage fight are patient who say they desperately need more option to control bad cholesterol or ldl christian jacob take eight medication to manage his cholesterol and related complication including blood thinner for the seven arteryopening stent he received since he ha a rare form of inheritable cholesterol that occurs in roughly one in a million people so he wa shocked when his insurance provider unitedhealth rejected his doctor prescription for repatha i wa floored he said how in the world can we be rejected for a medication that i meet every single standard for jacob said unitedhealth recommended he continue his current drug regimen to see if it lower his cholesterol he is appealing the decision unitedhealth which declined to comment on jacob situation due to patient privacy law said in a statement it u clinical guideline and scientific evidence when making coverage decision these new therapy offer additional ldl cholesterol lowering and outcome study are still pending said the firm recent medical history is littered with oncepromising drug that lowered test result like cholesterol yet failed to actually help patient considering the high price and limited data many doctor favor a go slow approach if youre going to spend that kind of money on a medication then you need to know that it really doing something said dr hal chadow of brookdale university hospital chadow ha successfully prescribed the drug to several highrisk patient but he want to see more research before using them more broadly some of the nation top cardiologist predict the drug will eventually reduce heart attack rate far below level currently seen with statin pill the standardofcare for high cholesterol since the s but study confirming those benefit are still month away a key reason insurer demand extensive documentation before reimbursing the drug i really think it a disservice to the public health to put people in charge of this who are essentially bean counter said dr steven nissen of the cleveland clinic the medical center ha assigned an expert to coach doctor on completing the insurance paperwork industry figure suggest a high bar percent of claim for repatha and praluent were initially rejected in the last quarter of according symphony health a firm that analyzes insurance data the company doing the rejecting say they are merely following prescribing instruction on the medicine which are approved by the food and drug administration dr steve miller of express script the largest pharmacy benefit manager say the company is approving more claim a doctor get better at picking the right patient and making sure they have adequate supporting data wall street continues to bet that the drug known a pcsk inhibitor will become blockbuster eventually while many have slashed shortterm estimate most analyst predict that repatha and praluent will generate combined annual sale of over billion by according to polling by evaluate pharma drug that generate billion or more annually are considered blockbuster the analyst projection depend on one key assumption that followup study show the drug reduce heart attack and death amgen is expected to unveil data from it pivotal study later this year with a similar study from sanofi next year but even assuming those study pan out some expert say the drug which are selfinjected once or twice a month depending on the medication and indication are still overpriced one analysis concluded that pcsk drug represent a low value for patient and said a fairer price would be roughly half the list price or between and per year according to the institute for clinical and economic review sanofi and amgen each criticized the group analysis disagreeing with it method and conclusion the boston nonprofit receives funding from foundation insurer drugmakers and academic institution dr steven pearson the group president say new approach are needed for pricing medicine based on performance he point to another pricey drug launched last summer novartis heart failure drug entresto ha been shown to reduce hospitalization and death more than older drug but it annual price ha slowed uptake novartis ha signed unusual payforperformance contract with several insurer offering partial refund if the drug fails to deliver better outcome pearsons group gave the drug positive mark in an evaluation last year we came out saying good evidence on clinical effectiveness and good value in november amgen announced a similar agreement with harvard pilgrim health care system if repatha doesnt lower patient cholesterol to level seen in company trial harvard pilgrim get a rebate that approach is already used in europe and could become more common here i think

source by dr mercola have you checked your vitamin d status lately ideally you want to maintain a vitamin d level of to ng ml yearround based on mounting research ng ml appears to be the magic number at which a whole host of health benefit are reaped vitamin d deficiency ha been linked to a variety of illness including heart disease stroke hypertension autoimmune disease type and type diabetesrheumatoid arthritis crohn disease multiple sclerosis cognitive decline alzheimers disease infectious disease and several deadly cancer this includes cancer of the breast colon prostate ovary esophagus lymphatic system and even melanoma vitamin d lower overall mortality risk it no surprise then that the institute of medicine iom report an association between vitamin d and overall mortality risk in one month long study involving more than healthy adult those who were most deficient in vitamin d had an percent increased risk of death from any cause this is the kind of benefit im talking about when i say it would be wise to temper fear of melanomathe deadliest form of skin cancerand weigh that risk against other benefit such a a significantly reduced risk of death from any disease moreover by adhering to sensible sun exposure guideline and making sure you do not get burned you can maximize your benefit and minimize the risk of skin damage that could lead to skin cancer on the whole overexposure not avoiding all sun exposure is the real problem when it come to raising your risk for skin cancer please read this important ftc article in a highly controversial action last week the ftc had me stop selling our uv light system which they classified a tanning bed but i wa providing a a far more effective option for vitamin d to the hundred of million of people who dont have access to enough sunshine the legal battle with the ftc lasted a few year and required me to travel to washington dc to meet with the ftc attorney to work through these issue i finally chose the lesser of all the evil option that were available to me if you have not yet read my detailed rebuttal to the ftc action against me please do so now and let me know what you think about this important health freedom threat i really am interested in hearing what your thought are on this important issue your input on this mean a lot to me thanks for taking the time to respond higher vitamin d lower cancer risk previous research found that a vitamin d level of ng ml wa associated with a percent lower risk of breast cancer breast cancer patient with an average vitamin d level of ng ml were also twice a likely to survive compared to woman with low level average ng ml most recently researcher at university of california san diego school of medicine report that raising your serum hydroxyvitamin d oh d to ng ml can slash your risk of all invasive cancer by percent according to study coauthor cedric garland drph we have quantitated the ability of adequate amount of vitamin d to prevent all type of invasive cancer combined which had been terra incognita until publication of this paper these finding support an inverse association between oh d and risk of cancer and highlight the importance for cancer prevention of achieving a vitamin d blood serum concentration above ng ml the concentration recommended by the iom for bone health improving vitamin d status is a key cancer prevention tool by pooling data from two previous studiesone randomized trial and one cohort study the former of which showed a percent lower cancer risk for woman with a vitamin d level of ng ml compared to a baseline of ng mlthey were able to get a much larger sample size with a broader range of vitamin d level this allowed them to more accurately determine the ideal vitamin d level for cancer prevention the study included all invasive cancer with the exception of skin cancer and had a followup period of nearly four year a reported by science daily in the lappe trial cohort the median blood serum level of oh d wa nanogram per milliliter in the grassrootshealth prospective cohort it wa higher ng ml the researcher found that the ageadjusted cancer incidence wa case per personyears in the lappe cohort and per personyears in the grassrootshealth cohort cancer incidence declined with increased oh d woman with oh d concentration of ng ml or greater had a percent lower risk of cancer than woman with level of ng ml or le primary prevention of cancer rather than expanding early detection or improving treatment will be essential to reversing the current upward trend of cancer incidence worldwide the researcher wrote this analysis suggests that improving vitamin d status is a key prevention tool research need to be translated into public health policy in a creighton university press release coauthor robert heaney md highlighted the importance of sensible sun exposure for vitamin d optimization and the need to modify public health policy with regard to sun exposure a noted in the press release be sure youre getting a much vitamin d a nature would give you under natural circumstance and you were wandering around outdoors exposing a lot of skin in the summer heaney said he refers to a study in which vitamin d level were analyzed for native tribe in east africa they received nearly international unit per day of vitamin d and had lower cancer risk in the institute of medicine recommended a vitamin d dosage of international unit per day thats not enough say heaney but what is enough for heaney he belief people should first discover how much vitamin d is in their blood level this is your blood level right now you know how much youre taking if you want it higher increase your dose so then everybody is in control of their own vitamin d nutritional status that way instead of having to be dependent on lab test and physician heaney said drawing on result from his study heaney belief vitamin d need to be widely discussed we have got to find a way to translate these study into public health policy heaney said at the end of january president obama established the cancer moonshot task force with the aim of creating a comprehensive plan to enable progress in treatment and care of cancer optimizing vitamin d is one of the foundational recommendation that really need to be part of that plan yet it notat least not yet how doe vitamin d help protect against cancer vitamin d influence virtually every cell in your body and is absolutely crucial to radically reduce your risk of cancer your organ can convert the vitamin d in your bloodstream into calcitriol which is the hormonal or activated version of vitamin d your organ then use it to repair damage including that from cancer cell vitamin d also trigger apoptosis cell death in cancer cell according to dr garland in nearly all form of breast cancer vitamin d affect the structure of your epithelial cell these cell are held together by a gluelike substance called ecadherin which provides structure to the cell ecadherin is made up of mostly vitamin d and calcium if you dont have adequate vitamin d that structure come apart and those cell do what they are programmed to do in order to survive they go forth and multiply if this cell proliferation get out of control you may end up with cancer if you have breast cancer in progress the addition of vitamin d can help stop cancer cell in their track by replenishing ecadherin once cancer growth is slowed your immune system can begin to get ahead of the cancer cell because it doesnt have to deal with such an overabundance of them it just disposing of the leftover low vitamin d predicts aggressive prostate cancer in related news researcher at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine recently discovered that men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer have vitamin d level below ng ml according to this study vitamin d may actually be used a a biomarker to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer a noted in a university press release the relationship between vitamin d and prostate cancer may explain some disparity seen in prostate cancer especially among african american men prior researchshowed african american men who live in low sunlight location are up to time more likely to have vitamin d deficiency than caucasian men but because vitamin d is a biomarker for bone health and aggressiveness of other disease all men should check their level lead investigator dr adam murphy said all men should be replenishing their vitamin d to normal level murphy said it smart preventive health care vitamin d dramatically improves heart function yet another recent study found that vitamin d ha nothing short of amazing ability to improve heart function in those with chronic heart failure the fiveyear long trial included patient undergoing conventional treatment for chronic heart failure half of them were given a vitamin d supplement the other half received a placebo in addition to their standard of care after one year the vitamin d group experienced significant improvement in heart function compared to the placebo group a reported by the independent dr klaus witte who led theresearch project told the independent the improvement seen in patient taking the vitamin were nothing short of amazing and called his team finding a significant breakthrough researcher made ultrasound scan of participant heart and measured the how much blood wa being pumped with each heartbeat to get a figure called ejection fraction the ejection fraction of a healthy person is usually around to per cent but it dropped to an average of per cent among the patient enrolled in the study for those who took vitamin d the ejection fraction wa improved from to per cent while the rest experienced not change for some patient this discovery mean regularly taking vitamin d could lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd which can correct dangerous heart rhythm the researcher note that even though they used a vitamin d supplement in this study exposure to sunlight would likely produce the same result for the simple reason that it all about achieving a higher vitamin d serum level comparing our modern lifestyle to that of ancient human who spent far more time outdoors the researcher link our current deficiency epidemic to chronic sun avoidance current advice to avoid sun exposure seriously endangers your health indeed dermatologist have severely compromised the public health by fighting an irrational and dangerous war against uv exposure be it from the sun or uv light device disease statistic reveal the sunscare campaign ha really been taken too far at present the u surgeon general the american academy of dermatology aad and many other cancer organization recommend complete and total sun avoidance in order to prevent skin cancer the aad will not even acknowledge different recommendation based on skin type even though it widely recognized that darker skinned individual need far more uv exposure in order to produce vitamin d in their skin adding insult to injury the u preventative task force suggests vitamin d testing is unnecessary and both the institute of medicine iom and the american medical association ama recommend vitamin d serum level and vitamin d intake level that are far below ideal based on the evidence in the medical literature the iom recommends taking just ius of vitamin d a day up to age but a pointed out in a paper the iom underestimate the need by a factor of due to a mathematical error this error ha never been addressed moreover research suggests it would require ius of vitamin d per day to get a majority percent of the population to reach ng ml meanwhile the ama u of ng ml a sufficient but a shown in the featured study this level significantly increase your risk for cancer ng ml is really the cutoff point for sufficiency in order to prevent a wide range of disease sun avoidance equal smoking in term of mortality risk sun avoidance actually increase your risk of death very similar to that of smoking that wa the conclusion of a recent competing risk analysis by swedish researcher who found that while woman with active sun exposure habit had a higher risk of melanoma compared to sun avoiders they also had a lower risk of mortality from far more deadly disease than melanoma including cardiovascular disease according to the author nonsmoker who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smoker in the highest sun exposure group indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for death of a similar magnitude a smoking compared to the highest sun exposure group life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure wa reduced by year when you look at the overall picture it clear to see that we are building the perfect storm for serious negative health outcome due to vitamin d deficiency the role of vitamin d in disease prevention a growing body of evidence show that vitamin d play a crucial role in disease prevention and maintaining optimal health there are about gene in your body and vitamin d affect nearly of them a well a vitamin d receptor located throughout your body according to one largescale study optimal vitamin d level can slash your risk of cancer by a much a percent keeping your level optimized can help prevent at least different type of cancer including pancreatic lung ovarian prostate and skin cancer how vitamin d performance testing can help optimize your health is it any wonder then that no matter what disease or condition is investigated vitamin d appears to play a crucial role this is why i am so excited about the daction project by grassrootshealth dr robert heaney is the research director of grassrootshealth and is part of the design of the daction project a well a analysis of the research finding grassrootshealth show how you can take action today on known science with a consensus of expert without waiting for institutional lethargy it ha shown how by combining the science of measurement of vitamin d level with the personal choice of taking action and the value of education about individual measure that one can truly be in charge of their own health in order to spread this health movement to more community the project need your involvement to participate simply purchase the

by butch meriwether you might ask yourself what this virtual who who of disease such a al amyloidosis chronic bcell leukemia chloracne diabetes mellitus type hodgkin disease ischemic heart disease multiple myeloma nonhodgkins lymphoma parkinson disease peripheral neuropathy porphyria cutanea tarda prostate cancer respiratory cancer and soft tissue sarcoma have in common the answer is simple they are the many illness the u government ha admitted are associated with the exposure to agent orange hopefully with time our government will admit there are other disease caused by their spraying of herbicide and defoliant than they originally admitted to some may ask what agent orange is and believe it or not more and younger people have never heard of that term even though it ha caused illness or death of thousand of people what is interesting is i wa at a doctor office not too long ago and a medical assistant ask me what agent orange wa when i mentioned that it had caused most of my medical issue the term agent orange is derived from the combination of code name for herbicide orange ho and agent lnx agent orange wa one of the herbicide and defoliant used by the u military a part of it chemical warfare program operation ranch hand during the vietnam conflict from through and besides that the gallon drum the deadly toxin were shipped in had a big orange strip around it thus where the name agent orange came from during the vietnam war the united state military sprayed million of gallon of deadly material containing chemical herbicide and defoliant in vietnam eastern lao and part of cambodia according to the worldwide web the program goal wa to defoliate forested and rural land depriving guerrilla of cover and to induce forced draft urbanization destroying the ability of peasant to support themselves in the countryside and forcing them to flee to the u dominated city thus depriving the guerrilla of their rural support and food supply many are unaware the u government also sprayed agent orange in korea many of the people exposed to agent orange and ill call them poor soul didnt find out the true justification for their debilitating illness until later in life and some never found out what caused their illness before they died another interesting fact is some vietnam veteran who have had or now have disease brought on by exposure to agent orange dioxin is not alone and many of their child are also infected by agent orange these child through birth are the second generation of people suffering from agent orange exposure and many wonder if there will there be a third or fourth generation the u government ha continued an attempt to downplay the effect of exposure to agent orange the red cross of vietnam estimate that up to one million vietnamese people are disabled or have health problem due to agent orange but the u government ha dismissed these figure a unreliable and unrealistically high many american are currently suffering or have died from the consequence of agent orange exposure without ever receiving medical care of monetary compensation conservative is estimate are that more than million american in addition to allied force and the vietnamese people were exposed to the deadly brew of pesticide and defoliant i guess im one of the more lucky one who now receive medical care and monetary compensation from my illness due to my exposure to agent orange for information purpose i served in vietnam during and just think i left vietnam in but the government didnt admit my illness were not associated to agent orange until about year later the money is great but the debilitating effect i suffer from my exposure to agent orange continues and each day i look healthier than i really am i have learned more about some of past illness and some from one that are now surfacing here is my who who of illness i have either suffered or currently now suffer heart attack and quadruple bypass operation yep i wa cracked open like a walnut in congestive heart failure ischemic heart disease type ii diabetes high blood pressure skin cancer neuropathy and they implanted a pacemaker in me last year i am also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease better known a copd but the u government hasnt yet admitted it is caused by my exposure to agent orange according to the department of veteran affair an agent orange settlement fund wa created by the resolution of the agent orange product liability litigation a class action lawsuit brought by vietnam veteran and their family regarding injury allegedly incurred a a result of the exposure by vietnam veteran to chemical herbicide used during the vietnam conflict remember they never designated it a a war the suit wa brought against the major manufacturer of these herbicide the class action case wa settled outofcourt in for million dollar reportedly the largest settlement of it kind at that time the settlement fund wa distributed to class member in accordance with a distribution plan established by united state district court judge jack b weinstein who presided over the litigation and the settlement because the plaintiff class wa so large an estimated million people the fund wa distributed to class member in the united state through two separate program designed to provide maximum benefit to vietnam veteran and their family most in need of assistance a payment program that provided cash compensation to totallydisabled veteran and survivor of deceased veteran and a class assistance program that provided fund for social service organization and network for the purpose of establishing and maintaining program for the benefit of the class a a whole application for the payment program had to be submitted prior to december and program operated over a period of year distributing a total of million in cash payment to member of the class action in the united state of the claim received by the payment program approximately vietnam veteran or their survivor received cash payment which averaged about each not much for their suffering and or death on september the district court ordered the fund closed it asset having been fully distributed another sad thing to come about wa the supreme court put the preverbal skid on thousand of american who faithfully served their county during the vietnam war and korea and who were exposed to the agent orange by making a ruling in the supreme court let stand a lower court ruling that the company were not responsible for the implication of military use of agent orange because the war material were supplied at the direction of the u government that decision basically made it impossible for individual exposed to agent orange to be able to sue dow chemical and monsanto south korea highest court upheld a ruling during july ordering two u agent orange maker to compensate vietnam war veteran in one of the country most prominent lawsuit the supreme court recognized the epidemiological correlation between the toxic defoliant agent orange and skin disease for the first time saying the victim should receive a total of million won hk million from dow chemical and monsanto it isnt too late for those u military veteran and their family to receive medical care and financial aid the veteran administration continues to attempt to help those military personnel and their family suffering from various illness brought on by their exposure to deadly toxin but they can only do so much spouse and dependent child of living veteran also may be eligible for health care and other va benefit and surviving spouse dependent child and dependent parent of veteran who were exposed to agent orange or other herbicide during military service and died a the result of disease related to the exposure may be eligible for survivor benefit if a military veteran dependent of a veteran or a parent of a veteran belief their illness wa caused by exposure to agent orange they should contact their nearest veteran service officer fraternal veteran service organization or department of veteran affair in order to learn more about applying for disability through the va apr http

the moon and return them safely he say at the heart of the new therapy is a chemotherapeutic agent called doxorubicin dox the drug ha been a mainstay of cancer treatment for year a it jam up dna in the cell nucleus and prevents tumor cell from dividing but when it injected into the bloodstream the drug can also kill heart muscle cell and cause heart failure which often force oncologist to either dial back the dose or discontinue it altogether delivering dox only to tumor cell is therefore highly desirable but it ha been a major challenge hoping to provide such cell specificity researcher led by mauro ferrari a nanomedicine expert a well a president and ceo of the houston methodist research institute in texas have spent year developing porous silicon particle a drug carrier the particle micrometerscale size and disklike shape allows them travel unimpeded through normal blood vessel but when they hit blood vessel around tumor which are typically malformed and leaky the particle fall out of the circulation and pool near the tumor that wa step one in delivering chemotherapeutic drug to their target but just filling such particle with dox doesnt do much good ferrari say even if a small amount of the drug find it way inside tumor cell those cell often have membrane protein that act a tiny pump to push the drug back outside the cell before it can do any damage silicon particle act a nanoparticle generator inpg that carry stringlike polymer loaded with a chemotherapy compound called doxorubicin pdox nature biotechnology to get large amount of dox inside the metastatic tumor cell and then past the protein pump ferrari and colleague linked numerous dox molecule to stringlike molecule called polymer they then infused the doxcarrying polymer into their silicon microparticles and injected them into mouse that had been implanted with human metastatic liver and lung tumor a with the previous study the researcher found that the silicon particle congregated in and around tumor site and once there the particle slowly degraded over to week a they did so the silicon particle released the doxcarrying polymer strand in the watery environment around tumor cell the strand coiled up into tiny ball each just nanometer across that size ferrari say is ideal because it the same size a tiny vesicle that are commonly exchanged between neighboring cell a part of their normal chemical communication in this case the doxpolymer ball were readily taken up by tumor cell once there a large fraction wa carried internally away from the doxexporting pump at cell membrane and toward the nucleus ferrari say at this point his team isnt sure exactly why the doxladen ball are ferried toward the nucleus though this is exactly what they wanted not only is the region around the nucleus devoid of doxremoving pump but it typically ha a more acidic environment than near the cell membrane and ferraris team used this to their advantage a well they designed the chemical link between dox molecule and the polymer to dissolve under acidic condition this release the dox at the site where it cell killing potency is highest up to of cancerbearing mouse given the treatment showed no sign of metastatic tumor month later the researcher report today in nature biotechnology in human ferrari say thats equivalent to being cancerfree for year if this research bear out in human and we see even a fraction of this survival time we are still talking about dramatically extending life for many year ferrari say thats essentially providing a cure in a patient population that is now being told there is none the new treatment isnt the first nanomedicine to show promise according to a recent nanotechnology working group study published in the lancet more than nanomedicine compound are now in clinical trial however the new work is promising libutti say because the silicon microparticles tend to target tumor in the liver and lung common destination of metastatic tumor cell the new work hold out hope for improving the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drug a well libutti say there no reason to believe you couldnt make a version of these particle with any chemotherapeutic agent dx idc

hey guy so ive been trying to do a much research a i can before making the post but i may a well make some inquiry since im hitting an impasse background i had a cc motor that basically soft seized and wa getting terrible compression eventually opened it up month later now that ive got a little bit of time and found that the piston certainly had it heyday is pretty much toast now a you can see in the pic the original thread i made is here but ill bring you guy up to speed in this thread either way so you dont have to read it all viewtopicphpft my old motor wa getting super low compression on my ohsoworldrenound harbor freight compression tester so instead of getting a new cc cylinder i opted to upgrade so i bought an athena cc kit and a dellorto mm phbn carb with a set of jet from to which i have not installed yet and brhs plug to chop yesterday we removed the old cylinder and installed the new cc athena one disclaimer however we installed the new cylinder piston etc properly lubed up and getting mm squish a per the instruction but we did not install this rubber oring here because we could not find a place for it and it wasnt covered in the instruction at all in video for other cylinder installation the head ha a place for this rubber ring and you lube it up and place it there when installing the cylinder but the head on my cylinder had no place for it trust me i checked every possible way that it could sit there so we installed everything without it and it ha the proper squish and everything but of course it seems like i probably misunderstood where it supposed to go and therefore put it all together without ever realizing i wa skipping a step however we did everything a legitimately a possible so im not sure which step i wouldve missed maybe it a totally critical piece maybe it a total nonissue piece i literally have no idea so the cylinder is installed the reed are installed the new phbn carb is installed the new spark plug is installed etc i tried getting it to start without the exhaust attached which i later realize may have been a mistake so i attached the exhaust but not the airbox and have continued to try and get this thing started thus far to no avail i dont have an electric start so im working solely with kick start i used the compression tester again and it would give me a reading of psi a to be expected from a hf compression tester but after more rigorous kicking it move up to psi with more rigorous kicking i honestly think i could get it up to but the return spring on my kick starter is super shitty weak and im a small man so it physically exhausting to keep kicking and kicking in this hot weather so i think my compression is fine with the new motor when we installed the phbn carb we used the needle assembly from the stock carb also of dellorto manufacture because i dont know how to change them out they appeared to be about the same though update ignore the underlined text i replaced the full carb the air screw is set at and screw out and im not sure what the fuel screw is at currently i planned to tune the carb after it got running but do you guy think i need to tune the carb ahead of time just to get the scooter running i havent touched the jet or the float at all on the new carb i believe the carb is getting fuel since the hose is wet when i pull it off the carb the oil line however is dry thus far and im pretty sure i need to get a new oil hose because the one i have is cracking really badly at the mouth and i need to zip tie it to keep it on the carb nipple i dont have any more slack on the hose otherwise i would just cut the end and reattach it so i need to replace the hose i believe so ive ordered part and from here http wwwjerseyshorepowersportscom f veh it may not be the right hose but im hoping it will be in the meantime with the ziptied hose how do i get the oil to travel into the carb until the time of writing this post i think it ha been attached too loosely and i just now went out and affixed it more firmly with the zip tie for a better seal however temporary how do i bleed the line to get rid of the air in the tube the manual mention bleeding the autopump but when i unscrew that bleed screw the oil just come out right there by the fan cover and not down the hose at the carb end obviously given the physic of the bleed screw location so how do i get oil down the line im hoping i havent done any damage yet by kicking it over so many time without realizing the oil line wasnt affixed firmly i read in this post viewtopicphpft that it mention applying vacuum to the petcock to prime the carb and im not sure how to do that all of the picture in the tutorial have expired im hoping the scooter isnt starting simply because i havent done enough to prime the new part for proper ignition but because im in an area where i havent seen much literature im no longer sure how to diagnose the situation i havent been able to find a whole lot of information about what i specifically need to do once the new part are completely installed the good news is that the issue ought not to be a problem with cylinder wear since it brand new and ha never fired before and once it running ill tune the carb so that wear on the engine is at a minimum but i cant do that yet since i cant even get it to start i read in this thread viewtopicphpft that it took op over kick to get it started so i dont know if my issue is because i havent given it enough kick trust me when i say i wa kicking the stool out of that kick starter on the new motor or what but i would guess that it because im skipping some important step for prepping a new engine setup any idea thanks for reading guy last edited by hunter on sun jun pm edited time in total jun http wwwzumaforumsnet phpbb

we do still provide care we never deny anyone regardless of whether they can pay the problem is that the care get so bogged down for example if a patient come into the ed with a heart failure exacerbation it often because they didnt take a medication called lasix this is entirely preventable but because this patient with a preventable problem is taking up an ed bed that mean we cant treat someone else who may need to be treated this doesnt sound like that big of a deal until you take into account all of the little thing that have to happen before this patient with a preventable problem is admitted from the ed to the inpatient unit to free up that ed bed for another patient i have to see the patient i have other patient i also have to take care of i have to interview the patient do a physical exam and draw blood to see whats going on the blood take about hour from the time that it wa drawn to when i get the result in the meantime i start treatment and call the internal medicine team to admit the patient it take the internal medicine team between minute to come see the patient and put in order to admit the patient to the inpatient unit then i have to wait for the admission nurse to find an inpatient bed for this patient to go to another physician in administration then review my note and check to see if the patient meet criterion to be admitted to the inpatient unit about hour after the patient is first put in an ed bed theyre finally moved up to the inpatient unit all of this wa because the patient did not take one medication jun http wwwredditcom r sandersforpresident comment pzdde peopledieeveryyearduelackofaccessto limitdqrmc,0

i believe they wont transplant if the patient drink alcohol also a you said there is the issue of the chf they want the patient to be a good candidate with good odds of surviving the transplant procedure can you ask at the transplant facility what their criterion are if she is in liver failure you are looking at more than quality of life issue liver failure and end stage liver disease esld is a life threatening condition if she cannot qualify for a liver transplant and ha liver failure i am very sorry to say it is a matter of time how much longer she can survive with a failing liver what ha her medical team said about her prognosis and her eligibility for transplant i have heard to be eligible she must have abstained from alcohol for at least month in most center to be considered eligible do you know her meld score most center require a meld of at least to be placed on the list and most patient who receive a transplant have a meld around depending on which transplant center they are registered with i am not a medical person and dont know your sister condition the best people to discus this with is her hepatologist and transplant center team jun http wwwmedhelporg post show post,0

uab researcher focus on five key area to improve care of cvd patient at am no comment according to the center for disease control and prevention approximately people die of heart disease in the united state every year thats one in every four death the impact of cardiovascular disease is quite large the university of alabama at birmingham is home to many talented investigator who study various aspect of heart disease within the school of medicine division of cardiovascular disease at the comprehensive cardiovascular center and across uab a primary goal of both the division and ccvc is to actively promote innovative interdisciplinary and translational cardiovascular research many distinct yet often complementary basic and clinical study are ongoing at uab with alabama ranking among state with the most heartrelated death this innovative research is providing benefit to patient now and in the future uab researcher are focusing on five key area with an ultimate goal of improving the care of cvd patient heart failure heart failure is a chronic progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to function adequately and distribute sufficient oxygen and nutrient to meet the body need in other word the heart cannot maintain it workload multiple researcher at uab are investigating the mechanism by which heart failure occurs a well a searching for way to prevent heart failure and devise improved treatment strategy heart failure can arise a a consequence of ischemic event such a a heart attack indeed heart attack survivor are at increased risk for heart failure development ongoing research is trying to uncover the nature of this relationship during ischemic event the immune system becomes activated which is essential for the repair of the heart however inappropriate activation of immune cell result in chronic inflammation which worsens damage to the heart thereby contributing to heart failure development director of the uab cardiovascular disease division and the ccvc sumanth prabhu md is currently focusing on the role of specific immune cell population in producing heart damage and on finding a way to manipulate immune system so they do not become hyperactivated similarly research in the laboratory of ganesh halade phd is studying novel lipid specie known a resolvins which are able to reverse inflammation in the heart roger white phd and his collaborator gm anantharamaiah phd are exploring the antiinflammatory property of highdensity lipoprotein mimetic compound in atherosclerosis and other disease state other important area of heart failure research involve energetics regeneration cellular survival and remodeling study in the laboratory of min xie md are currently defining whether activation of selfpreservation mechanism such a autophagy promote survival of heart cell thereby attenuating contractile dysfunction following a heart attack in term of remodeling louis dellitalia md is studying the mechanism of extracellular matrix remodeling during heart failure which can lead to stiffening of the heart both xie and dellitalia have identified novel therapeutic target that improve cardiac function in preclinical model heart failure research further extends to the clinic with multiple active clinical study assessing the intramyocardial delivery of mesenchymal stem cell a a novel therapeutic in patient with heart failure genomic determinant of patient response to pharmacological therapy immune cell activation in chronic disease heart failure outcome research using the intermacs registry and testing of novel

associated cardiomyopathy these include novel strategy for coronary intervention and stent design outcome after percutaneous structural valvular intervention and developing paradigm for adjunctive antiplatelet therapy after interventional procedure nita limdi phd is leading an institutional precision medicine effort to uncover the clinical impact of genomic variation in the metabolism of antiplatelet drug after coronary intervention hypertension research hypertension or high blood pressure typically ha no symptom but can have deadly health consequence if not treated according to the american heart association nearly million u adult have been diagnosed with high blood pressure suzanne oparil md professor of medicine and past president of the american heart association is part of a groundbreaking study called the sprint trial that suggests changing blood pressure guideline could cause the falling death rate from heart attack and stroke to drop even more the trial found that a pressure below wa preferable for highrisk patient a number of hypertension patient are unresponsive to conventional treatment strategy these individual known a resistant hypertensive patient require

even casual inspection of a map of the southern hemisphere suggests that the coastline of eastern south america and western africa fit together like the piece of a jigsaw puzzle this same thought occurred to the naturalistexplorer alexander von humboldt who during the early s found similarity between animal and plant fossil in south america and western africa and common element between the mountain range in argentina and south africa subsequent explorer saw similarity between fossil in india and australia in the german geophysicistmeteorologist and polar explorer alfred wegener went a step further and proposed that the present continent were once fused into a single landmass which he called pangaea alllands expanding upon this theory in his book the origin of continent and ocean wegener described how pangaea subsequently split into two supercontinents laurasia corresponding to the presentday northern hemisphere and gondwanaland also called gondwana southern hemisphere an event now thought to have occurred to million year ago wegener could not provide an explanation for continental drift and his concept wa roundly rejected until after his death in from heart failure during an expedition to greenland the occurrence of continental drift wa finally accepted in the s when the concept of plate tectonicsinvolving plate that are in constant motion relative to each other sliding under other plate and pulling apartwas established according to the theory of continental drift a single giant landmass pangaea split into the two supercontinents laurasia northern hemisphere and gondwana southern hemisphere long before continental drift wa acknowledged by the scientific community naturalist were finding ancient fossil of the same or similar plant and animal in continent thousand of mile apart and separated by ocean fossil remains of the tropical fern glossopteris were found in south america africa india and australia while those of the family kannemeyrid a mammallike reptile were uncovered in africa asia and south america by contrast some living plant and animal on different continent are very different from one another for example all the native mammal in australia are marsupial and not placental mammal which suggests that australia split off from gondwanaland before placental mammal evolved feb http knowledgeclassblogspotcom continentaldrifthtml,0

when it come to keeping your heart a healthy a possible there are some factor such a genetics that you cant change if you have a family history of heart disease then you are at increased risk yourself however there is plenty you can do to decrease your risk whether you have a family tendency or not here are some proven change you can start making today to reduce your risk of heart problem in the future when it come to keeping your heart a healthy a possible there are some factor such a genetics that you cant change if you have a family history of heart disease then you are at increased risk yourself here we reveal eight step everyone can take to lower their risk quit your habit the obvious one is to stop smoking smoker die on average year earlier than nonsmoker a shown in a study of a million uk woman published last year if you can stop smoking before you are you are time le likely to have health problem than if you continue a well a benefiting your heart you will see rapid improvement in your breathing mood and reduce your risk of stroke diabetes cancer circulation problem and numerous other problem watch your weight the association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong not least because obesity put you at risk of type diabetes which in itself increase the risk of heart disease and multiple other condition if you carry more weight around your waist than your hip you are even more at risk to calculate your waist to hip ratio divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement a high ratio over for woman or for men mean increased risk of health problem such a heart attack high blood pressure or diabetes even if you arent that overweight the link between heart disease and weight is extremely strong not least because obesity increase a person risk of type diabetes which in itself increase the risk of heart disease is fatfree best you have probably been advised to cut out saturated fat and replace butter with unsaturated fat spread this is because a diet high in saturated fat is thought to be one factor that lead to high level of bad cholesterol in the blood which in turn may cause narrowing of the artery and heart attack however there is now some controversy a to whether these dietary change make much difference to your risk of heart disease a recent overview of multiple study found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease the jury is still out on this one and it shouldnt be used a an excuse to eat high fat doughnut pastry chip and other source of processed saturated fat however butter cheese and cream in small quantity may not be the complete villain they were thought to be say byebye to bacon reducing the amount of red meat is recommended a study have shown that eating a large amount can increase heart failure by up to per cent however recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed were talking ham salami sausage bacon etc with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat the researcher calculated that for each g of processed meat eaten per day about one or two extra slice of ham the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by per cent these result require confirmation with further study but a processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible reducing the amount of red meat is recommended a study have shown eating large quantity can increase heart failure by up to per cent but recent evidence suggests this link is more pertinent with processed meat such a bacon salami sausage and ham eat le salt the british heart foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life adult should have le than six gram one teaspoon a day cutting back on salt doesnt just mean keeping your hand away from the salt cellar when you are eating there is also a lot of hidden salt in processed food check the label and cook from scratch wherever possible then you are in control say no to sugar a large population study in the united state showed that people who consumed more than per cent of their daily calorie from added sugar had an almost three time higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had le than per cent independent of other risk factor including weight more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too and a it offer no nutrient whatsoever it is time to cut back gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drink avoid fizzy drink and look carefully at label you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sort of food both sweet and savoury a study in the u showed people who consume more than per cent of their daily calorie from added sugar had an almost three time higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had le than per cent of calorie from added sugar keep active dont despair if you are a couch potato it never too late to start a well a helping with that weight loss a recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefit if starting exercise such a running or cycling after a you would have done if you had started before the age of there are numerous other benefit from exercise toowhat are you waiting for stress le and finally while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy dont let it stress you out a stress doesnt help your heart either the stress hormone cortisol can increase unhealthy fat around the middle raising your risk of heart problem a well a leading to craving for high fat and sugar food which only make thing worse so for a healthy and happy heart start making a few small change today your heart will love you forever it is vital to keep active if you want to sustain good heart health but couch potato do not have to despair for it is never too late to start study suggest recent evidence show you get the same heart health benefit of starting exercise after a you would have done had you started in your apr http ameboireneblogspotcom saybyebyetobaconandstuboutyourhtml,0
by scott morgan mount kilimanjaro meter above sea level is one of the tallest in the world the mountain which is found in northern tanzania ha continued to be a popular tourist destination over the year the mountain is a major challenge to conquer and requires adequate mental and physical preparation to increase the chance of succeeding you need to start training for kilimanjaro early at least two month before the hike the type of physical routine that you get involved in should help you build cardiovascular endurance and your muscle strength weight training help you improve your performance and help protect joint such a the ankle knee and the spine which tend to be strained when hiking your target should be to carry a backpack of about pound a you take a flight of stair at a rate of step a minute the amount of training that is required greatly depends on your initial fitness level person that have not hiked before will on average require a longer duration of physical exercise than those that hike regularly beginner are advised to start by walking outdoors for short distance such a a mile and increasing the gradually to say four or five mile take stair a often a possible it is important that you keep consulting with your doctor to ensure that you remain medically fit the doctor will subject you to a full checkup to find out if you have any disease that would make it difficult for you to go for the hike some of the condition that may be a cause for concern include metabolic disorder such a diabetes chronic respiratory condition such a asthma and cardiovascular disorder such a heart failure and hypotension apart from being physically fit you need to also prepare your body physiologically at high altitude the air is thinner and oxygen supply is markedly reduced high altitude training help your body to preacclimatize so that you can cope with such strenuous condition the best way of achieving this is to be involved in several shorter hiking exercise regularly this can be easily done within tanzania where there are a number of smaller mountain near kilimanjaro to be used for practice whether you are a beginner or an experienced climber you need to arrive a few day earlier this will help you relax and shake off the jet lag at the same time it will give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the local climate and food there is at least a chance of making it to the peak if you arrive in good time you need to carry with you a number of essential item the technical clothing will typically include hiking pant a long sleeved shirt a waterproof jacket with a hood a pair of glove and sport bra for woman important equipment specific to the exercise include a map a compass or gps sleeping bag and headlamp among others other accessory include a towel toilet paper soap and so on person that are traveling to tanzania need to ensure that they have the proper documentation that will allow them enter the country visa requirement apply to most country outside the commonwealth ensure that you find out in advance what is required for your specific case it would be unfortunate to miss out on the opportunity after week of preparation about the author if you are looking for the fact about training for kilimanjaro go to our web page online here today further detail are available at http wwwisoldeulrichcom now feb http getcustomersadvertiseblogspotcom basicsontrainingforkilimanjarohtml,0

case report in vascular medicinevolume article id page http dxdoiorg case report successful endovascular repair of an iatrogenic perforation of the superficial femoral artery using selfexpanding nitinol supera stent in a patient with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia department of cardiology vascular medicine grn hospital weinheim weinheim germany received november accepted april academic editor hiroyuki nakajima copyright tom eisele et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative common attribution license which permit unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited abstract the treatment of acute thromboembolic limb ischemia includes wellestablished surgical thrombectomy procedure and in recent time also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy using straub rotarex system this modality not only enables efficient treatment of such thrombotic occlusion but also in rare case may imply the risk of perforation of the occluded artery herein we report the case of a perforation of the superficial femoral artery sfa in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia the perforation wa successfully treated by implantation of selfexpanding nitinol supera stent and without the need for implantation of a stent graft introduction peripheral artery disease pad exhibit increasing morbidity and mortality during the last few decade and is estimated to affect over million people worldwide including up to of elderly primary care individual patient with symptomatic pad exhibit a life expectancy of within year of followup whereas patient with critical limb ischemia cli show significant poorer outcome with amputation and death rate of and respectively within the first year after diagnosis especially patient with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia are in high risk of major amputation and death due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction such patient are usually older than year and show further comorbidities including atrial fibrillation and history of heart failure the treatment of this limb and lifethreatening condition includes wellestablished surgical thrombectomy procedure and in recent time also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy procedure using straub rotarex system if required in combination with local thrombolysis this method enables quick and efficient treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion despite the low complication rate of rotational thrombectomy perforation of the occluded artery have been reported previously herein we report the case of a perforation of the superficial femoral artery sfa in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia which wa successfully treated by implantation of selfexpanding nitinol supera stent case presentation an yearold female patient wa referred to our department with new onset of severe pain paleness and pulselessness of her left leg since hour duplexsonography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery cfa figure and the patient wa immediately scheduled for digital subtraction angiography dsa the patient had history of arterial hypertension and heart failure but no history of clinically evident pad dsa confirmed the thrombotic occlusion of the cfa figure a and interventional treatment wa initiated after injection of mg aspirin and iu of heparin after insertion of an guide wire rotarex catheter ab medica gmbh d�sseldorf germany thrombectomy wa performed in the cfa and in the proximal superficial femoral artery sfa figure b resulting in antegrade flow in both sfa but with high remaining thrombotic burden in the cfa figure c and d after repeated rotarex catheter thrombectomy a perforation of the sfa wa noticed which persisted despite prolonged inflation using a mm balloon figure e g due to persistent perforation the implantation of overlapping mm nitinol supera stent abbott vascular illinois usa wa performed which resulted in complete repair of the vascular injury of the sfa figure h and i local lysis wa subsequently performed due to high remaining thrombotic burden of the cfa using mg bolus injection of actilyse recombinant tissue plasminogen activator boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh ingelheim am rhein germany and continuous infusion of mg h for further hour repeated dsa wa scheduled for the next day in the mean time pain symptom of the patient improved whereas she recovered from paleness of the lower limb except for the area of her distal foot the next day dsa revealed complete resolution of the thrombus in the cfa figure a however reocclusion of the sfa wa unfortunately noticed figure a orange arrow requiring repeated rotarex catheter thrombectomy and implantation of further selfexpanding nitinol innova stent mm and mm boston scientific ratingen germany in the sfa figure b subsequently good angiographic flow wa shown in the sfa and in the popliteal artery with a vessel runoff of the anterior tibial artery figure c f after the second angiographic procedure pain symptom and limb paleness and paresthesia were completely resolved in addition holter monitoring revealed the presence of atrial fibrillation and the patient wa put on treatment with aspirin mg daily clopidogrel mg daily and mg subcutaneous fxainhibitor fondaparinux for week ambulatory duplexsonography at week of followup demonstrated a good triphasic flow pattern in the sfa figure and the patient wa put on treatment with coumadin figure thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery cfa absence of flow can be appreciated in the distal part of the vessel associated with thrombus formation red arrow the origin of a collateral artery can be depicted proximally to the vessel occlusion yellow arrow figure occlusion of the cfa is noticed by dsa a rotarex catheter thrombectomy reestablishes antegrade flow in the cfa and sfa b but thrombotic burden remains high a it can be appreciated by the orange arrow in c mid and distal part of the sfa with thrombus formation can also be appreciated in d after repeated rotarex thrombectomy a perforation of the sfa is noticed with persistent despite prolonged balloon inflation orange arrow in e g subsequently overlapping nitinol supera stent are implanted h resulting in complete cessation of the bleeding complication orange arrow in i figure during the second angiographic session dsa reveals not only complete resolution of the thrombus in the cfa a but also reocclusion of the sfa orange arrow in a requiring repeated rotarex thrombectomy and implantation of further selfexpanding nitinol stent b subsequently good angiographic flow can be achieved in the sfa and in the popliteal artery with a vessel runoff of the anterior tibial artery c f figure triphasic flow in the sfa at week of followup discussion to the best of our knowledge this is the first case reporting the placement of selfexpanding nitinol supera stent for the management of a perforation in a peripheral artery in the past decade significant technical development have occurred with endovascular therapy of acute thromboembolism which offer several advantage over open surgical embolectomy technique for the treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion although the straub rotarex system is widely available and well established for the treatment of such thrombotic lesion perforation of the occluded artery have been described previously and in our case in such case usually stent graft are employed however such stent graft are expensive and are usually deliverable using f sheath this may require an additional arterial puncture under full anticoagulation or lead to additional time spent for changing the arterial sheath which may aggravate bleeding complication in our case the sfa perforation could be successfully treated using selfexpanding nitinol supera stent which are deliverable using a f sheath conclusion herein we report the placement of a selfexpanding nitinol supera stent for the management of a perforation in a peripheral superficial femoral artery further novel option of complication management a described in our case may shift

paul wa taken my ambulance to mercy hospital er with his heart pounding erratically and two week to the day that he wa released from the hospital after having a catheter ablation to correct atrial flutter click on this link to read that story it been an up and down journey since paul had a procedural followup appointment monday of this week between the ablation and this appointment hed had a couple of bad spell although nothing even remotely close to that which took him to the er in the first place but concerning nonetheless we learned from craig hoffman the physician assistant who saw paul that flutter ablation is about to effective naturally were hoping that paul isnt in the to for whom it ineffective if the flutter procedure ha been successful then what he experiencing when his heart is misbehaving is probably atrial fibrillation but he on a medication for that so after thorough discussion we collectively decided paul should wear a heart monitor for a couple of day to make sure there no flutter and see how frequent and how severe the fibrillation is we learned however that there a third component in the mix sleep apnea also know a obstructive sleep apnea wow wa i ever ignorant about this condition previously i thought well sure you dont want to stop breathing altogether when youre sleeping but if it just a little pause that always pass no harm no foul wrong at the bottom ive included an article from the national institute of health national heart lund and blood institute explaining what sleep apnea is and the danger it pose so paul is going to have a sleep study done in the next few week well figure out what to do from there what is sleep apnea sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pause in breathing or shallow breath while you sleep breathing pause can last from a few second to minute they may occur time or more an hour typically normal breathing then start again sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound sleep apnea usually is a chronic ongoing condition that disrupts your sleep when your breathing pause or becomes shallow youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep a a result the quality of your sleep is poor which make you tired during the day sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness overview sleep apnea often go undiagnosed doctor usually cant detect the condition during routine office visit also no blood test can help diagnose the condition most people who have sleep apnea dont know they have it because it only occurs during sleep a family member or bed partner might be the first to notice sign of sleep apnea the most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea in this condition the airway collapse or becomes blocked during sleep this cause shallow breathing or breathing pause when you try to breathe any air that squeeze past the blockage can cause loud snoring obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight but it can affect anyone for example small child who have enlarged tonsil tissue in their throat may have obstructive sleep apnea central sleep apnea is a le common type of sleep apnea this disorder occurs if the area of your brain that control your breathing doesnt send the correct signal to your breathing muscle a a result youll make no effort to breathe for brief period central sleep apnea can affect anyone however it more common in people who have certain medical condition or use certain medicine central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone snoring typically doesnt happen with central sleep apnea this article mainly focus on obstructive sleep apnea untreated sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure heart attack stroke obesity and diabetes increase the risk of or worsen heart failure make arrhythmia ahrithmeahs or irregular heartbeat more likely increase the chance of having workrelated or driving accident note from me other research indicates that sleep apnea can also damage the brain the below excerpt is from the sleep foundation researcher have found yet another reason why people with obstructive sleep apnea osa should get tested and treated for the disease according to a recent study published in the journal sleep patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated reduced brain gray matter concentration gray matter refers to the cerebral cortex where most information processing in the brain take place and here from webmd is how osa cause or is correlated to increased risk here are seven health problem you might face if you have osa high blood pressure if you already have it obstructive sleep apnea can make it worse waking up often during the night can cause your hormone system to go into overdrive which boost your blood pressure level when you cant breathe well in your sleep the level of oxygen in your blood drop which may add to the problem treatment doe make a difference though some people with high bp who get help for sleep apnea can cut back on their blood pressure medication heart disease people with osa are more likely to have heart attack the cause may be low oxygen or the stress of waking up often stroke and atrial fibrillation a problem with the rhythm of your heartbeat are also linked with the condition sleep apnea disrupts how your body take in oxygen which make it hard for your brain to control how blood flow in your artery and the brain itself type diabetes sleep apnea is common among people with this condition up to of them have osa obesity raise a person risk for both disorder although study havent shown a clear link between sleep apnea and type diabetes not getting enough shuteye can keep your body from using insulin properly which lead to diabetes weight gain extra pound raise your chance of getting sleep apnea and the condition also make it harder to slim down when youre overweight you can have fatty deposit in your neck that block breathing at night on the flip side sleep

great use of vocabulary it still doesnt negate the underlying contention and reasoning for why obesity isnt recognised in a positive manner in society if we are here to talk about obesity in a symbolic manner let me offer a different spectrum could obesity be representative of a privileged life with access to an abundance of food which correlate to economic prosperity is it not indicative of a first world physique we have individual who are suffering from malnutrition in region of africa who we emphatically donate to for the greater good and for humanity and rightly so yet we move onto the opposite spectrum and see individual who have no solid control over their eating habit and we suddenly correlate such thing with artistry no that isnt fair and by blending artistry with obesity doesnt negate the negative impact it may have there a big difference between being overweight and being morbidly obese it is the latter that should not be treated in a positive life the underlying contention of having a positive body image is certainly admirable but we must be able to realise the reality we live in in the end we are human being who have the capacity to suffer chronic illness and heart failure due to a myriad of injury rampant obesity could certainly be correlated with unhealthy eating which correlate to possible clogging of artery leading to a possible heart attack a one example these health effect are often not cognisant with the unwary until it happens to them which i have had the personal unfortunate experience of knowing someone with such illness it not a pretty face i dont necessarily disagree with the premise of body image and reducing depression but im also a realist and that individual have the opportunity to lose weight there is a fine line between being overweight and being morbidly obese which should not be forgotten jun http wwwfacebookcom permalinkphpidvwallstoryfbid,0

what you have described is and i dont want to lessen your position but very similar to a lot of u on here it took me month to be diagnosed i wa on the puffer nebuliser and even had one doctor tell me i wa hyperventilating i even had chest xrays and no one saw my enlarged heart it wa only after a day of testing a ct scan and then the echo that i wa diagnosed i wa actually very excited to finally get a diagnosis otherwise in my view it wa off to the psychiatrist this all happened in year ago and i am still going at the time there wa a genuine life expectancy of year for cardiomyopathy but luckily i wa diagnosed the year that cardiverol wa introduced to the world and for chf patient my ef wa i like you had an excellent result from my angiogram pristine artery i didnt get my icd until i got a biventricular pacer with the icd but i wa decompensating at the time and it wa what i needed to keep me going to me it saved my life i know it is a big shock to get a you say this brick in your chest i wa on diagnosis but had a year old daughter so there were a lot of issue that i faced also year on my brick ha saved my life time by shocking me out of cardiac arrest it ha kept my heart going through a lot of other illness not related to heart disease it even saved me when anyone else without an icd would have died from septicemia i have been through cancer gall bladder disease and septicemia a mitral valve replacement a a result of the septicemia and more recently appendicitis all in the past year through all of these illness i have felt assured that i will not die a a result of a sudden cardiac arrest and a my artery are still good i felt that i wa protected through all these issue my heart function is not that good at the moment my ef ha dropped and i am back in chf again but honestly the last thing i worry about is the icd it ha proved that it is a life saver to me mind you the first few year i had the device it really didnt need to do much but in the last year i would be dead if it wasnt there to protect me i look at all the other people out there in the community who could drop dead from a sca and know i am protected just look at the young athlete that drop dead whilst playing or running the tragedy of this is that if they were protected with an icd they would have been able to get up and continue on with their life so yes it is a very big procedure to come to term with it also is a sign that you are not physically well that you have heart disease you are faced with your own mortality and the realization that your world ha changed but once you go through the grieving process regarding these issue you will come out the other side with a certainty that you are protected by your little in your chest so glad you have come on here for support this is a brilliant group you will not get any of the normal platitude from u we speak the truth and from experience nothing like peer on peer support a i am sure you realize a a psychologist jul http wwwicdsupportgrouporg board viewtopicphpftp,1

must watch possible first case of cte diagnosed in the living cte is football bogeyman researcher arent sure exactly what make some player susceptible to the disease and others not factor such a genetics and age of first impact may play a role but what is clear for many researcher is that it occurs because of repeated head trauma that result in a buildup of an abnormal protein called tau the tangle of tau can overtake part of the brain that control for memory mood and aggression the symptom are similar to alzheimers but begin much earlier there are four stage of the disease and the most severe case can result in suicidal thought thing to know about cte fred jr remembers hearing the headline of other player dave duerson junior seau and mike webster all seemed to have parallel to his father life thats when you start to realize ok yeah the rage the forgetfulness the identity crisis he said gavin even talked to his father about suicide and his dad brushed it off im not going to do that nah nah just joking around gavin recalled it a conversation no son should have with their father all gavin could say wa i hope you wouldnt i love you just know that if you hear me hear that first cte ha no cure it can only be diagnosed with an autopsy tia mcneill had no idea at the time what her husband future looked like but she knew that when he passed she would have omalu evaluate his brain we wanted to know she said diagnosing the living in omalu approached the mcneills with a new technology that he had helped developed and is invested in called taumark it u a radioactive tracer called fddnp to bind to tau protein in the brain the tau protein can then be seen on a positron emission tomography or pet scan omalu explained to cnn that this technology could only be licensed to corporation and that his motive behind it is not profit but research when omalu and his team examined the scan there were angry red splotch all over fred mcneills brain his wife wasnt surprised living brain scan of five former nfl player including fred mcneill critic say the test is too early it only been used on former football player but more importantly they say it isnt precise enough it bind to tau a well a amyloid protein a signature for alzheimers omalu said it not just what the marker is highlighting but where the highlight are tau ha a distinctive pattern in cte and omalu said his test is tracing the tau in the same place he found it in autopsy meanwhile mcneills dementia continued to worsen his outburst became more extreme ultimately the family moved him into an assisted living facility it wa more for his safety tia mcneill said a different kind of care fred mcneill found a home at the silverado beverly memory care community in los angeles a few block from gavins office and minute away from his wife home silverado is one of the nfls two preferred provider of memory care it wa the best care they could find but tia mcneill said it wa never a perfect fit there were yearolds at the facility and fred mcneill wa just in his early s still relatively fit he wanted to walk throw around football he loved music and karaoke former nfl player need a different kind of care tia mcneill contends sylvia mackey wife of hall of famer john mackey agrees she wrote a letter to thennfl commissioner paul tagliabue about caring for her husband dementia the letter wa the impetus to form the plan the nfls benefit plan for player experiencing dementia lou gehrig disease and parkinson sylvia mackey get call from nfl wife all the time about what to look for and what they can do to help their husband she recalled when her husband entered a nursing home surrounded by folk in wheelchair who could barely get around she remembers him pushing the other resident in their wheelchair she said it wasnt just the age difference but the pure physical difference of the former football player they need larger bed and larger equipment a the disease progress and they become le mobile they need lift chair thing they need to help them move around and the staff cant shoulder that physically themselves they need equipment to help mackey said fred mcneill wa a linebacker for the minnesota viking she also said the former athlete still identify a player brother of a certain bond tia mcneill agrees she said her husband lit up when he found out manfred moore a former pro football player wa also at silverado the two had played college football against each other when fred mcneill wa at ucla and moore at rival usc it not clear how many former player are now in assisted living facility in loren shook president and ceo of silverado told the chicago sun time we have treated about nfl player we have about a dozen right now cnn ha reached out to the nfl retired player association but ha not heard back however through the nfl alumnus association sylvia mackey is now working with validus senior living to open an assisted living facility in all nfl city each facility would work with a younger and healthier population dealing with dementia there no road map there no support for this tia mcneill said there no protocol when youre afflicted with cte what it look like and how to care for that person best she want there to be more a final blow in march fred mcneill wa diagnosed with lou gehrig disease also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or al study have found that former professional football player are four time more likely to suffer neurodegenerative disease such a al parkinson and alzheimers mcneills hand had become shaky he wa losing control from the waist up he eventually wa put on feeding tube because he couldnt eat on november mcneills family brought him home from the hospital they wanted him to enjoy his last day in peace we brought him home on a monday morning and he passed he wasnt here hour tia mcneill recalled photo athlete and cte former minnesota viking linebacker fred mcneill died in november at the age of due to complication from al however an autopsy confirmed that he suffered from cte what make mcneills case even more remarkable though is that he wa potentially the first to be diagnosed while alive doctor used an experimental new

by debra redman lmt nctmb margarette is the picture of health so a mini health crisis came a a surprise in the same week her divorce wa to be final she wa scheduled a an outpatient for an ablation a type of heart surgery on wednesday and replacement breast implant surgery on friday the postsurgical recovery would have most people flat on their back for more than just a few day imagine my surprise when she answered her door for a manual lymph drainage massage the day after the heart surgery the immune system doe not react well to being overstressed margarette wa experiencing a very stressful time in her life she had swelling in her right leg from the malfunctioning valve in her heart the collapsed breast implant left her chest feeling heavy a a medical massage therapist i suggested she relieve some of the discomfort with a medical massage modality called manual lymph drainage mld this specialized technique is designed to stimulate the immune system and help the lymphatic system achieve healing in the body margarette received mld both before and immediately after her surgery preoperative mld clean the area so that there is little bleeding creating an environment that decrease pain level and the chance for infection this primed her lymph system to start moving toxin out of her body before the surgery the effect of mld last up to hour depending upon the duration of the massage the result is that it slows the amount of bleeding during surgery and cause the body to begin detoxifying the chemical from the anesthesia and other medication immediately the postoperative session kept the process going diminishing pain level to the point where margarette didnt need any medication she recovered so quickly she wa back at work by the following wednesday missing only five workday mld u very gentle precise stroke to promote the release of fluid buildup in the body called edema any interruption in lymph circulation can impair the functioning of the body immune system it ability to repair damaged tissue and cause chemical imbalance in the body if left untreated the swelling could potentially lead to a more serious medical condition called lymphedema edema is a condition defined a swelling that occurs when interstitial fluid build up in the muscle of the body lymphedema is a build up of fluid in the lymph system unlike edema lymphedema can become a chronic condition that ha consequence for the whole body swelling pain numbness sensation of pressure increased susceptibility to infection loss of mobility and impaired wound healing are all a result of chronic lymphedema chronic swelling ha four level of manifestation micro edema mild or pitting edema nonpitting edema and severe hardening the first two can be reversed and usually completely alleviated with mld the last two cannot be reversed but mld may help relieve the symptom some reason why the lymph system will respond with edema include illness lack of exercise injury ie sport surgery disease and being on an airplane flight mld help both acute and chronic condition type of condition that mld cannot help include kidney disease nephritis leaking blood vessel varicose vein third degree burn congestive heart failure untreated high blood pressure obstruction in the circulation system thrombosis or clot and active cancer most people learn about the effect of lymphedema when they experience cancer based on client feedback very little information is disseminated to noncancer patient about how to take care of the swelling they experience after a sport injury accident or surgical procedure not very many people are told about the benefit of mld prior to surgical event or the impact on healing after surgery i have discussed mld with heart surgeon podiatrist chiropractor and orthopedic and plastic surgeon it is my concern that few know how to fully utilize mld or pay any attention to the role that edema play in healing doctor dont seem to be addressing the impact chronic swelling ha when treating condition that wont heal appropriately i have used mld to treat client who have experienced injury from sport acute and chronic accident or surgery cancer patient in remission parkinson patient pregnant woman fibromyalgia chronic fatigue allergy and sinus problem i recommend mld for breast cancer prevention and maintenance if you knew that this natural

about year ago i completed my internal medicine training in upstate new york which included a weekly outpatient clinic and ward rotation at the local va hospital i love military history and enjoyed the opportunity to talk to many ww ii veteran back then there were even a few ww i soldier still around in those day these were everyday working class even humble men who quietly lived common life but had participated in some of the most storied and celebrated battle in the last century they were part of a generation that made tremendous sacrifice and embodied many of the value that made america great it wa my privilege to hear some of the story of this so called greatest generation first hand one ww ii veteran wa in my clinic for over two year so i wa his physician for an extended period time he wa a tall large man with a long grey beard and he always wore a confederate cap i always thought the hat reflected a bit of his gentlemanliness demeanor with just a hint of a rebel in him he wa a simple man who although i wa so much younger basically a kid in those day always treated me with the utmost respect and called me doc but never with my last name we got to know each other fairly well a he wa in severe chronic heart failure so i wa seeing him in my clinic on a frequent basis to adjust his medication one day he told me his own personal story about the war it turned out he had served under patton in north africa he described the scene of his last battle in that war and in my mind eye i felt i wa there he wa on a high hill and the german had overrun and nearly surrounded his position most of his company had been killed or retreated from his position he could see the enemy advancing on three side it wa rock and gravel and sand like the moon there wa dust and the smell gunpowder and the smoke and odor of burning diesel and oil the german could not see his exact location and so were firing indiscriminately up the hill on the other hand from his vantage point he could see the terrain well and wa systematically picking off enemy soldier one at a time with well placed rifle shot he wa apparently incredibly deliberate and collected under the most intense circumstance his own foxhole buddy wa already down but he thought still alive it wa only a matter of time before they were both either dead or prisoner suddenly the enemy stopped firing and my friend knew that the german were sending a scout to ascertain his precisef location to better target his position he also knew that he only had a few moment left so he picked up his buddy in a fireman carry and started running away from the enemy position had he not been carrying his friend he would have been able to move much faster he wa nearly over the crest of the hill that would have put him temporarily out of sight and gun range when he wa knocked down a bullet tore through his left shoulder and upper chest he fell heavily to the ground with a gaping chest wound his friend rolled a short distance completely inert it wa only much later he would find out his buddy did not survive my friend wa bleeding heavily but his next breath collapsed his lung and much of the bleeding must have slowed he lost consciousness and awoke in the dark he wa unable to get up and drifted in and out of consciousness all night the next day he wa picked up by american force that had reclaimed that territory of the battlefield his wound were severe and his recovery prolonged but he survived though he never fought in uniform again he wa awarded the purple heart but other more prestigious metal of distinction would never come because no one else lived to testify about his heroism he had not told the story to many people he said because he just never enjoyed talking about the war a lifetime of cigarette and alcohol had taken a toll on him a he fought other inner battle not the kind of fight that were won by gun or violence when i met him a i mentioned he wa also battling severe health problem remarkably i wa able to keep him out of the hospital for a fairly long time however eventually thing fell apart and he wa hospitalized and started a down hill spiral he had been in for a few week and just not getting better during that time he had no visitor and he never spoke of family so i suspected he wa alone in the world i wa on call every third night which typically meant working hour straight it wa after midnight and i visited him in the icu the room wa dark and we could only see from the dim light in the hallway he knew that he only had a short time left he thanked me for the care i had given him and then started talking about the war again you know doc i never regretted the thing i did or those german i killed i knew if i didnt kill them they would kill me but lately in my dream im seeing the face of all those young german boy i killed i thought to myself their face i pondered if this wa a trick of his memory but didnt ask how close quartered his combat experience had been generally you see an enemy face in handtohand combat i had always presumed the enemy wa far away and never really knew exactly how many there had been now in his final battle he wa going back to one of his first battle death is the final enemy and my friend knew he wa going to the same place to which he had sent others to year ago he died that night alone with his memory and dream he wa a soldier a patriot a hero and had become my friend many of u dont really understand the physical and mental burden our veteran carry with them often for their entire life it wa my honor to know and serve this true hero thank you friend for your service and sacrifice and also thanks to all the countless others who have served in uniform fought killed and even died for our safety and freedom apr http

i think there a fundamental misunderstanding here betablockers such a propranolol act by blocking beta and beta receptor throughout the body beta receptor when stimulated cause an increase in heart rate among other effect beta receptor when stimulated cause a whole bunch of other thing such a vasodilation relaxation of blood vessel relax bronchiole etc now betablockers are usually given to someone in heart failure or with atrial fibrillation in these state the heart is working to hard at rest and is doing damage to itself because of this work because it is working so hard it is becoming ischemic a lack of oxygen and other nutrient betablockers block beta receptor and cause the resting heart rate to decrease this cause the heart to not work a hard at rest which increase the survival for people with these condition now betablockers block a certain amount of betaadrenergic stimulation but not all of it that would be very dangerous so when you exercise even if you are taking your betablockers there is such a flood of acetylcholine the molecule that stimulates betablockers that it can bind to receptor even in the presence of the drug and cause an increase in heart rate therefore even if you are on the drug you still get increase in heart rate with higher than normal level of stimulation mar http wwwredditcom r askscience comment ja howdobetablockerslowerrestingheartratebut limitdke,0

it done thank goodness so monkeyman went in on thursday early morning without complaint because he couldnt eat or drink or had to wake up early just to go and sit and wait and wait and wait at hospital he is such a sweet sweet boy having an aspergers child in the house i cant help but appreciate his cooperation and nondefiant behaviour so very very much it make his and our life soooo easy i know it unfair that i compare him and his sister but hey theyre sibling it impossible not to notice when one child scream her head off about everything and another say yes mom of course mom to every thing you demand of him so monkeyman got to the hospital and entertained himself on his tablet for hour and hour and watched a bit of tv we got to talk to all three the doctor before the op the pediatric gastroenterologist ge answered some of our question and really calmed my nerve the phdoctor came to discus the procedure and what gerd is etc and wa really surprised when she realised not only do we exactly know and that our whole family ha it but that she wa the one that did my my eldest daughter and eldest son phstudies year ago a well then came this really really young looking anaesthesiologist it scared my husband a bit to trust our son who ha had anaesthesia problem into the hand of someone looking like he hasnt even finished medical school let alone specialised already but somehow i wa ok with it thinking that maybe a a young dr he would be up to date on all the newest thing and it turned out to be true before the operation my husband went to a lot of trouble to contact the previous anaesthesiologist that took care of monkeyman the ge doctor asked him to my husband requested a list of all the medication they used and we put all of it together on one page which we presented this newest anaestheologist with he listened carefully to the symptom and progression that monkeyman experienced every time he received anaesthesia it wa always the same he would wake up confused like any normal child screaming fighting cry then in time he calmed down and sometimes would fall asleep when he had the pulmonary hypertension he slept for hour after the anaesthesia still this is all normal then about hour after the anaesthesia everytime the vomitting start doesnt matter how strong the antinausea med they give him during the anaesthesia this continues for the rest of the day gagging and vomitting inbetween nausea then the physical tiredness he can barely lift his head walking to the bathroom is too much to bear he just lie down on the couch and doesnt move for hour and hour about hour after anaesthesia the fever start this continues for about hour around this time or a bit earlier his nose start to run and it clog up with his eye s tearing exactly like a cold the worst isnt the symptom but the fact that you can see this is an ill child that something really is wrong but when you try to tell someone they all say oh but it normal to not feel well after anaesthesia yeah i know but this wa different the first time he wa a small child of year old and we thought that he mustve come down with a bug unrelated to the fact that he had anaesthesia just by chance having it at the same time a he wokes up from anaesthesia the second time it wa very fishy to see the exact same progression of symptom but again i thought he mustve came down with a bug at the same time a the procedure or that maybe the pipe down his throat wa to blame he wa then age he wa really really ill we wrote it partly off due to the fact that he had pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart but still it really bothered u seeing him so very very ill so whenever someone just mention a possible gastroscopy we backpedalled we just didnt want to face the anaesthesia again our instinct wa to protect our child and putting him through anaesthesia went through everything we knew wa good for him our instinct screamed but we knew at some stage it just simply had to be done so when this dr said it needed we told her about our fear and experience so she asked u to get a list of all the medication used in his previous anaesthesia i didnt even think it possible but all doctor came through for u and when we presented the newest anaesthesiologist with the list he said he believe that it the gas that make monkeyman so ill after the gastroscopy the gastroenterologist came to talk to u for quite a while shes such a sweet caring doctor anyway she said that the anaesthesiologist belief that monkeyman may have malignant hyperthermia she said it time accentuating it sound like the anaestheliologist really wanted u to know that he think thats what it is which make sense to me when i googled it malignant really doe mean malignant it scare me big time but at the same time i have this huge relief in me one le puzzle to try and figure out a possible diagnosis basically it mean that a gene on one chromosome mutated and make the body unable to handle gas inhalant anaesthesia the body basically kill itself within hour fortunately monkeyman havent had a bad case of it yet just the start of the symptom like the fever and exhaustion and nausea he must just never ever get gas again then hell be fine also no cocaine ecstasy or such which i dont really see a a concern at this point i know itll be strange for people to understand the relief of knowing my child probably ha malignant hyperthermia but we had this sword hanging over our head fearing monkeymans next anaesthesia it feel like we have removed that sword now it an enemy we could deal with and we dealt with it it make me happy and relieved and grateful make sense so how wa monkeyman after the gastroscopy well he wa confused for about minute directly after the operation he fought and tangled all the wire something terrible then he woke up properly watched tv for an hour ate stood up and walked out of the hospital such a trooper no nausea until late the night no vomitting no fever unfortunately still the runny nose clogged sinus and red and teary eye so so much better but not all symptom gone no lying down all day no abnormal tiredness nothing he ate and drank normally unlike the previous time just a normally tired little boy who had minute of anaesthesia really just normal of course he only got iv anaesthesia not gas but he barely flinched when they put the iv in so allinall such an easy child he asked for daddy to go in with him i wa really so happy about that it wonderful to see their bond and i had more than my share of seeing my baby made to sleep the only thing is now just this runny nose and teary eye and clogged sinus why would anaesthesia do that to him is it still an allergy is it a reaction similar to the malignent hyperthermia is it because his immune system is lower than the average child the gastroenterologist wa very happy with everything during the operation she found no structural abnormality like constriction or growth or such no clear sign of issue except that the stomach wa quite red abnormally but nonspecific red she took biopsy of the throat tummy and intestine she also took a lot of blood shes gonna get a new baseline for him since the last one wa over a year ago and then when she wa done the ph doctor inserted the ph study while he wa still under so that he wa saved that trauma at least thank goodness for caring doctor he didnt like the little pipe at all it bothered him quite a bit a much a it did me shame man but again he wa a trooper i kept him at home and after hour we went to the ph doctor to take it out she only gave u some prelimenary result shell send the full report to the ge dr the news wasnt good even despite being on high do of med x a day already he still had a positive gerd test he refluxed x during the day and x during the night of those event didnt just rise up into the throat but the contends of the stomach very little acid due to the medication moved right into his mouth poor little boy no wonder he complains about nausea and aspirated his stomach contends when he wa on le medication so ya our hope of lowering his medication dossage wa dashed she said we simply cannot do that to him it will damage his lung to the point where it can kill him she said after year of aspiration it look like smoker lung now we wait for the ge call next week to tell u what the biopsy and blood show and her opinion on the reflux report ah well im so good with waiting these day boeboes long road ha taught me at least that hahaha no really im ok with the waiting i remember how i used to complain on this blog about the waiting but ive come a long long way i have learned patience and perserverance and i know nothing ever get to the point of being fixed so no point in being impatient it not a destination it a road with reststops along the way maybe come to think about it that wa the lesson i needed to learn maybe that answer the why so many people have asked or mentioned this past few year how come one family could have so many little rare issue they deal with well maybe that wa so that i could reach this point of acceptance and just founding the joy in the here and now enjoying every

mikhailoh they need better data from which to draw incorrect conclusion another example of what i cite a a huge factor in rising cost a perfect example of this b is the betablocker standard when i wa using ether a resident it wa common practice to hold beta blocker inderal eg for two week before elective surgery these med though lowering blood pressure also depressed the heart and along with general anesthetic that could lead to heart failure or worse thensome time in the s a study showed that continuing betablockers wa beneficial so for the last year ive had to tick a checkbox that either the patient took his betablocker or i administered it intravenously if i didnt give it i had to document why guess what quote n the joint guideline from the european society of cardiology and european society of anesthesiology esc esa the new recommendation state that betablockers are not recommended in patient without clinical risk factor given that the drug do not decrease the risk of cardiac complication and may even increase this risk a retrospective cohort study also suggested betablockers in these lowrisk patient might increase the risk of death more here http wwwmedpagetodaycom surgery generalsurgery rather than allowing me the doc to make a clinical judgment i have to follow a flowsheet one that may once again be proven erroneous go eat an egg apr http szetaboardscom thenewcoffeeroom single pt,0

sometimes if feel like the tide just wont stop coming so we sigh and pick up our bucket and shift a little up the shore only to have the wave soon reach our toe again the tide that threatens to pull u out if we stay frozen ill never forget the first time i got swept the doctor said my blood clot wa large the biggest hed ever seen but i had a newborn baby but i wa only but i really wasnt ready they said it could be fatal and suddenly their eye looked at me different a i called my family to tell them they needed to come i looked at a picture of my four daughter before long a they whisked me away to the hospital i prayed please god let me be back to raise them at that time while i wa terror stricken the doctor implanted a metal filter in my main vein leading to my lung to prevent any clot from breaking off and traveling there to kill me i remember being awake a they threaded a tiny metal basket down through my neck through my heart down into my abdomen a safety net they told me until i formed another clot above it and that clot became fear in the form of my own body the month after that were beyond harrowing i wa scared to be alone in case i collapsed and the kid were left alone i wa scared to drive for fear that they clot would travel and kill me and id cause an accident in the process i wa literally scared to move i had talk with the girl about how much i loved them they needed to always know talk with justin about if he wa faced with raising them alone please be gentle please surround them with loving woman please remind them of me fitting everything you want to say in is even harder than it sound constant appointment several ambulance ride blood test genetics testing all to later find that the reason id gotten the clot in the first place wa because of a cluster of event including a genetic condition called factor v leiden my body once triggered to clot would have a difficult time shutting off that process a chain effect but even though that wa the most terrible time in my life through god grace i recovered slowly and timidly nervous to put my toe back in the water the girl grew i wa grateful to be there to watch it and never took it for granted time marched on but never far from the what ifs of if it ever happened again the fear ha stifled imprisoned taunted it ha whispered to me in dark room and been my alarm clock many morning i had just started getting counseling for what my therapist thought wa ptsd from it when suddenly a month ago completely out of the blue and four year almost to the day i felt that familiar pain again and the panic returned surely it wa just anxiety surely i just needed to breathe deeper calm my thought surely but unable to let it go i called the doctor and almost collapsed when after an ultrasound they told me i had a clot once again the room spun i rung my hand i can barely remember leaving that place how could this be my path again god didnt i suffer enough and the wave were up to my waist fear had returned with his ugly face to whisper see i told you so youll never be able to get away i own you but a fear tried once again to take over god voice reminded me that what satan lay out for evil god reweaves for good now ive had week of test blood work and appointment back to the same seat in the clinic waiting room that still somehow feel warm from when i left the doctor in order to verify there wa no further clotting up higher ordered a ct scan he said just to be sure i went and i shook and tear dripped into my ear a i lay there on my back being prepped i prayed in that tube staring up at the light painted to look like a beautiful sky a if a painted cherry blossom and a cloud wa going to calm me i wa done soon enough and i went home and then i waited and waited and waited a week went by with no word surely that wa good news right surely they would have contacted me by now if something wa there they werent expecting by this friday i wa praying a prayer of thanks a i pulled into my mom group at church thankful for the grace of each new day thankful for what wa obviously good but then i got the message the ct scan result had not showed any further clotting but incidentally had seen fluid around my heart a note said i needed to call my cardiologist right away the message said try not to worry it should have also said definitely do not google but of course i did and the finding were so scary that the water around me looked like mud there are many reason one could develop fluid around their heart and many different level you could have a small effusion caused by a virus or illness you could have a medium sized one caused from trauma or autoimmune issue or in the worst scenario you could have a large effusion that could be life threatening and often had a very high mortality rate caused from cancer or bleeding from the heart surely mine wa a small then i told myself i felt ok they would have called me to come in right away if it were more serious right i spent my weekend in on off fear cry often laughing some thinking constantly the wave slowly moving up further and now around my neck this morning before i could even call her the phone rang it wa my cardiologist her voice sounded serious a she laid out the next step to diagnose the why of this new finding id need an echocardiogram and some blood work to start once they figured out the reason and actual amount of fluid they would know how to treat it she said she had seen the report but would need to know more before she could know how to move forward and then i asked it even though i didnt want to i asked what size are we talking ive been looking online and she said the thing i didnt even think could be well it look like it large and now i wa underneath the undertow wa so strong heel pitched above my head she said word after that i barely heard other than to go to the er if i wanted to expedite thing and not wait any more day to begin being treated so i went barely able to move my eye side to side i knew from my reading that sometimes the large effusion are caused by warfarin which im on for the clot that often in that case the fluid they are seeing is blood that it make it very complicated to even know how to treat because the blood thinner make the fluid dangerous to drain because you could bleed out but to go off of my blood thinner at this point could cause wide spread clotting from the factor v which could also kill me from the minute i got to the hospital it wa clear my doctor had called ahead i wa taken in quickly and by a half an hour later i had had an ekg an iv started tube of blood taken blood pressure cuff placed history gone over and a chest xray done the nurse entered and said that what they were concerned about wa an enzyme indicating impending heart failure that i would most likely be admitted soon the doctor came in and repeated what the nurse had said with the addition of indicating id most likely be undergoing a transesophageal echo which would require sedation and wa an inpatient procedure though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i asked to please use the bathroom and when i closed myself in i stood and begged god i begged for a miracle and then i heard it be anxious for nothing but in all thing with prayer and thanksgiving make your request known to god i wa forgetting the thanksgiving because isnt that just what satan love to draw our eye and heart away from the good that weve been granted to pull u into something that stifle to call from the dark bush hey look over here with thanksgiving thankful that theyd at least caught this thankful for a quick moving diagnosis thankful i knew that no matter what wa about to come he held all of my day in his hand and nothing could separate me from them i went back to the room where my mom waited looking concerned i asked her if shed pray specifically for complete healing specifically i said for the issue to disappear those were the word and then something happened five minute later the doctor appeared with something in his hand do you want the good news or the bad news he said not the bad i replied covered in tape and tube and monitor i really dont want the bad news at all well thats good he said because there isnt really any i held my breath what wa he about to say he said he didnt really know how but there appeared to have been a typo that it looked like the report had eluded to a large pericardial effusion but that for some reason there wa no mention of it in the conclusion portion of the report he wa seeing he said it should have been highlighted a the number one thing but it wasnt even mentioned he thought this wa strange when reading it so he had asked to have the scan sent to him and he had called in the hospital radiologist to help him review them he said that after looking at the scan carefully they both agreed that not only wa the effusion not large but there wa no evidence of any fluid around my heart and my heart wa perfectly healthy i could hear the second hand tick silence could this even be furthermore he said there wa also no evidence of additional clotting and my filter wa still in place i wa free to go home a gasp above the surface i cried in that moment like a crazy person sobbing laughing laugh sobbing and that went on for over an hour a the doctor and nurse and tech came in to say they just couldnt believe it and congratulation i heard him calling my doctor with the news and suddenly i wa laying on the shore clothes wet face down but alive and grateful that sometimes when the tide is pushing in it bringing you back in with it because he asks u to trust and keep our eye fixed and he will quiet the storm because never fails actually mean never god did a miracle for me today in my physical heart and in the heart at my core the one from where my real life stem two doctor had seen that report and been alarmed enough to have me admitted but suddenly there wa nothing there the beautiful sky i wa looking up at wa the real one because he perfect all that which concern u because the promise is that though we walk through the fire we will not be burned i lift my eye up to the mountain where doe my help come from it come from the maker of heaven and earth the maker of heart and blood and body from the maker of future the maker of a plan for me and the one who set my foot over and over on solid ground i dont know what is planned for me because of the strength ive gained through these thing i dont know the people ill meet who might need to hear that ive been there too and made it out alive and they will too i dont know what lie over the dune and out into the world beyond this ocean of trial what i do know is that my faith wa strengthened today after seeing that i have faced fear and possible death multiple time and each time have been spared and ever moved up to the dry part of the shore apr http kbecauseisaidsoblogspotcom thedrypartsofshorehtml,1

patient with heart failure often have a buildup of scar tissue that lead to a gradual loss of heart function but researcher say they are making progress toward an approach that could shrink the amount of heart scar tissue while replenishing the supply of healthy heart muscle the finding published in the journal cell stem cell came from researcher from the university of north carolina school of medicine our past work brought hope that we could one day improve heart function in people with heart failure by converting scar tissue into beating heart muscle said li qian phd assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and the study senior author but that wa more of a proofofprinciple study and the conversion rate wa quite low now we have found the barrier to conversion and by removing it we have been able to significantly increase the yield of musclelike cell heart failure ha no cure and currently affect an estimated million people in the united state common symptom include shortness of breath fatigue and swelling all of which often worsen a the heart weakens over time our hope is that this approach could extend the life of people with heart failure and markedly improve their quality of life in the future said qian who is also a member of the mcallister heart institute at unc in qian and her colleague created a cocktail of protein capable of converting fibroblast which create scar tissue into cardiomyocytes heart muscle cell that beat on their own exactly the way regular heart muscle cell do notably the team approach did not require converting fibroblast into stem cell which is typical of other tissue regeneration technique qians approach lowered the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation in experiment using mouse the cocktail proved successful at shrinking the size of scar tissue and improving heart function but the process had remained disappointingly slow until now we wanted to have a better yield and shorten the conversion time so in the future this process could be fast easy and efficient for disease modeling or for treatment qian said the new breakthrough came when the team discovered that a gene called bmi interfered with the expression of other key gene needed to convert fibroblast into heart muscle cell bmi previously had been investigated for it role in neural stem cell and cancer cell but this is the first study to pinpoint a role in it interaction with cardiogenic gene when the team depleted bmi the conversion rate sped up markedly the percentage of fibroblast that transformed into heart muscle cell increased fold repressing bmi also allowed qians team to simplify the cocktail by reducing the number of different protein in it mar http thirdagecom acellularremedyforheartfailure,0

what is the kingdom of god where is the kingdom of god is the kingdom of god just another word or synonym in the gospel for heaven the kingdom of god spark many question and rightly so when searching the gospel for kingdom of god or kingdom of heaven which appears more often in the gospel according to saint matthew one is amazed by the numerous reference throughout the century believer have pondered the meaning and implication of the kingdom of god and scholar certainly have grappled with the phrase and filled library shelf with volume of thoughtprovoking commentary what can and must we do with the reality of the kingdom in our day in pope paul vi penned the apostolic exhortation evangelii nuntiandi on evangelizing in our day early in the exhortation the bishop of rome state a an evangelizer christ first of all proclaims a kingdom the kingdom of god and this is so important that by comparison everything else becomes the rest which is given in addition only the kingdom therefore is absolute and it make everything else relative the lord will delight in describing in many way the happiness of belonging to this kingdom a paradoxical happiness which is made up of thing that the world reject the demand of the kingdom and it magna charta the herald of the kingdom it mystery it child the vigilance and fidelity demanded of whoever awaits it definitive coming evangelii nuntiandi clearly pope paul vi see the kingdom of god ha the central experience of jesus public ministry so central that everything in his ministry is grounded in the kingdom similarly the catechism of the catholic church paragraph through examines the manifold depth of the kingdom in jesus public ministry based on these text a well a other catechetical document the roman missal and the sacred scripture i have compiled a working description note not a definition of the kingdom of god that ha been helpful to undergraduate deacon candidate seminarian and believer there is certainly much room for discussion in this description and is in no way intended to be exhaustive the kingdom of god is god our father intervening definitively in the created order the kingdom is not necessarily or strictly a specific place although place will be a dimension of the kingdom a a way of living the kingdom is a way of living an ongoing activity initiated by god the father in loving concern for being that have been created in his image and likeness we have become addicted to sin in such a way that we cannot break free from it grip by our own power we have come to enjoy sin too much sin tentacle have woven deeply into our life that often we cannot see or think clearly we may from timetotime have great desire to rid ourselves of sin desire that are marvelous but desire that do not contain within themselves the power to effect what is desired more often than not however sin ha dulled our sen to divine love sin ha numbed u into complacency and entitlement to the point that we even approach the thing of god and church from a selfish point of view with no regard to the life of faith a engagement with the divine person who call me a an individual and a a community to ongoing conversion manifesting charity and service to the body of christ so powerless over sin so addicted to the false self we have become that an intervention is needed the kingdom of god this intervention is a work of power a power that transforms and surpasses the power of creation god the father work is quintessentially a work of restoration not annihilation ask anyone in construction and he or she will tell you that it is often easier to raze a building and start over than to renovate or restore renovating an existing structure that doe not have a level plumb or square line in it make restoration tedious and time consuming not to mention the surprise lurking behind old plaster and lathe yet ask any restorer when the project is complete and most likely she or he will tell you that in spite of it challenge and frustration it wa and continues to be a labor of love such is the kingdom neither creation nor humanity is destroyed the creator doe not raze the created order and begin anew even though humanity make continuous choice reinforcing the addiction to sin the father with eye of love gaze upon each human person in such a way that each of u are declared precious so precious are we in the sight of god the father that none of u are disposable expendable or useless each of u ha a particular vocation in the father plan of salvation and our very being is so precious to the father that the loving transforming power of his kingdom call u from the addiction to our false self to our true self a icon of the father love this transforming power becomes a way of living hence not a specific place that one can absolutely pinpoint you cannot use google map or a gps device to find the kingdom the kingdom is god the father way of living it is a way of living that is the son jesus he life each moment of his life attentive to his father word and will spending night in communion with his father jesus teach with his life that kingdom living is living joined connected related whatever word you wish to use to god the father a a way of living the kingdom is a radical embrace of the first commandment no one nor no thing nor anything we deem important come before the father or interferes with our relationship with him kingdom living is life that provides the essential to a sister or brother in need matthew and celebrates praise and thanks the father for all that he is doing in life cf luke the magnificat it is in this sense that one can speak of the kingdom a a place wherever one is when living a the father command there is the kingdom the kingdom a a way of living ha been prepared by the prophet of old many of the prophet called israel to authentic worship a message that is still quite valid despite present misguided and weak argument that attempt erroneously at a division between religion and spirituality for the prophet the spiritual relationship formed by the covenant necessarily bound one religion freely to observe and practice a continuous ongoing changeofheart the prophet knew that the energy required to live justly a a covenant person did not come from within a person by himself or herself such living depended upon the mercy of god celebrated and experienced in authentic worship such worship then propelled one to be an instrument of charitable service in the world acting not on one own initiative and power in the name of god the kingdom a a way of living is now definitely revealed and embodied in jesus here all ambiguity concerning the kingdom is erased the kingdom is essentially a person the person jesus only he can lead u to the love of the father in the spirit and make u share in the life of the holy trinity catechism of the catholic church paragraph the incarnation make the kingdom a reality in the created order to effect the father loving transformation of everything most especially the human heart responding and living the love revealed to u in christ jesus is the essential work and live of the kingdom of god is there more to be said about the kingdom certainly but more importantly the kingdom is not intended for study but for living while some of these reflection may give u some insight such insight is always directed to worshipping god the father and serving one another in the name of jesus christ with the gift and power of the holy spirit a jesus teaching on prayer is proclaimed today at mass consider i

result from vericels positive phase b ixcelldcm clinical trial of ixmyelocelt presented today at acc and published in the lancet patient treated with ixmyelocelt had a percent reduction in clinical event compared to placebo cambridge mass april globe newswire vericel corporation nasdaq vcel a leading developer of patientspecific expanded cellular therapy for the treatment of severe disease and condition today announced the presentation and publication of result from the company phase b ixcelldcm clinical study of ixmyelocelt in patient with advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy dcm the data were presented today by timothy henry md at the latebreaking clinical trial session and press conference at the american college of cardiology acc th annual scientific session and published in the lancet dr henry is director of cardiology at cedarssinai heart institute principal investigator of the study and coauthor of the lancet publication the ixcelldcm study met it primary endpoint of demonstrating a reduction in the total number of allcause death cardiovascular hospitalization or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visit to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the month following treatment with ixmyelocelt compared to placebo said dr david recker vericels chief medical officer from a safety perspective the incidence of adverse event including serious adverse event in patient treated with ixmyelocelt wa comparable to or lower than patient in the placebo group we are very excited about the result of this clinical trial and greatly appreciate the contribution of the patient investigator and dedicated personnel who participated in this study we have a major unmet need in the treatment of class iii and iv heart failure said amit n patel md director of clinical regenerative medicine and associate professor of surgery at the university of utah and the chair of the ixcelldcm steering committee based on these positive result we are encouraged that ixmyelocelt ha the potential if approved to represent an important new option for patient with class iii and class iv heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy the ixcelldcm clinical trial is a multicenter randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase b study to as the efficacy safety and tolerability of ixmyelocelt compared to placebo vehicle control when administered via transendocardial catheterbased injection to subject with endstage heart failure due to ischemic dcm a total of patient with new york heart association nyha class iii or iv heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either ixmyelocelt or placebo and patient were treated at site in the united state all clinical event in the primary and secondary endpoint were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent adjudication committee the trial met it primary endpoint with patient in the ixmyelocelt group having a percent reduction in allcause death cardiovascular hospitalization or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visit to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the month following treatment compared to the placebo group p the primary endpoint wa driven by a reduction in both allcause death and cardiovascular hospitalization in the primary endpoint without procedurerelated event three percent of patient in the ixmyelocelt group died and percent had cardiovascular hospitalization one or more time compared to percent and percent respectively in the placebo group all death were adjudicated to be due to cardiovascular cause with respect to the secondary endpoint of the trial the component of the primary endpoint were also analyzed using the win ratio in a hierarchical manner to incorporate both the incidence and timing of the endpoint component the win ratio result of showed that more often ixmyelocelt wa the winner in that the time to death left ventricular assist device placement heart transplantation or time to cardiovascular hospitalization wa shorter for placebotreated patient but this difference did not reach statistical significance the time to first event wa longer in the ixmyelocelt group compared to placebo but wa not statistically significant there were no significant structural change in left ventricle cavity size or left ventricular ejection fraction a measured by echocardiogram in either the ixmyelocelt or placebo group both treatment group had an improvement in the nyha class and six minute walk test with no statistical difference between the group at month using last observation carried forward overall there were fewer adverse event and serious adverse event in the ixmyelocelt group compared to the placebo group adverse event included those typically related to catheterization or injection procedure the ixcelldcm trial showed a statistically significant reduction in clinical event driven by both cardiac mortality and cardiac hospitalization at month compared to placebo these result are consistent with two previous phase a study which showed that ischemic dcm patient treated with ixmyelocelt experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular event during follow up compared to control patient vericel will host a webcast at pm et on tuesday april to review ixmyelocelt and the phase b ixcelldcm trial result dr gary l schaer md of rush university medical center and a member of the ixcelldcm steering committee will present an overview of the result from the ixcelldcm clinical trial and dr ross tubo vericels chief scientific officer will present additional background information on ixmyelocelt and describe the potential benefit of expanded multicellular therapy in the repair and regeneration of ischemic tissue the live webcast

well a additional data and analysis not presented at acc are currently available at investorsvcelcom eventscfm about dilated cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy dcm a progressive disease of the heart is a leading cause of heart failure and heart transplantation dcm is characterized by weakening of the heart muscle and enlargement of the heart chamber leading to systolic abnormality difficulty of the left ventricle to pump blood heart enlargement and poor function generally lead to progressive heart failure with further decline in the ability of the heart to pump blood

for a long time and it actually said from the moment when i heard the onkowozie how the system jbla game i decided to look into the matter and adopt a system to my sw and what should i be worse of course there will always be expert on the topic and i will hew peg on the head for a solution that i made i am not an expert on audio but for me such a solution is sufficient just with age no longer hear everything there will be some people who will not correspond to my concept and will stand by the only possible solution of course for them namely the removal of the radio signal rca or changing the radio and adding an amplifier i do not fully coincide i do not want to interfere with radio or a system of wire and do not want to give up the display i want to be in the middle looked like a factory the more that the ka is not a car premium but actually for me unless however is if someone doe not fit yet can not do this or delegate the task to those skilled in ca but it usually involves the release of a thick money or do it your way of course getting the original is possible but easy is not extra price for a set of prohibitive i started to gain diagram audio system with jbl and their little analysis i needed were the gut i bought it on a wellknown site i needed were amp eg a subwoofer other speaker audio system found i have all the part amplifier can be purchased for approx z although there are even pln the subwoofer wa expensive approx pln subwoofer wa so i actually needed for the speaker but write about it at a later stage after the observation namyleniach thought and zastanawianiach bought speaker called midbass hertz ev kit esk http wwwhertzaudiovideocom wpcotechpdf i bought them together with spacers dedicated to the peugeot at the price of pln tweeter harmankardon with a set of factory peugeot acquired with triangle mirror for pln pc for those who do not have anything they can buy a whole set of ecc approx pln with spacers mdf if someone want to it can acquire other speaker according to the abundance pocket it not quide election speaker anyway about speaker can write and write and always will be an opportunity to do something better there had to be a better sound for relatively little money expert ca will be upset that i installed speaker in the rear door because scene break perhaps they are right but this is the car a family and travel together so if sitting in the back wanted to listen to music i would have to increase the volume and this would lead me crazy another purchase wa soundproofing mat on the door the choice fell on the mat soundproofing tank alubutyl stp silver and foam rubber damping mm k this is only the first the inside of soundproofing with the remnant of a glue after the original film here paste the image of the front door already taken i forgot to take picture during their wrapping and now i have to remove the bacon without soundproofing door do not expect effect soundproofing is essential for now i have done only the front but i look forward to some free time money and ill back plus luggage who know if not yet tempted to center a cursory analysis of pattern found that they are all based on the same standard speaker output of the radio it doe not matter from what if the rb rd rt or rd are connected directly to the amplifier jbl on the other hand we work out the sound of the individual channel and sends them to the speaker already a you can see it can specify block that are interested u radio amplifier lp speaker front left lp hf speaker front left tweeter lt speaker rear left lt and pt sub subwoofer left and right channel in one housing pt speaker right behind the pp hf speaker front right tweeter pp right speaker front electrical connection radio rb d and the amplifier and speaker connection installation speaker must perform in accordance with the schedule a the radio usually ha the power you have to focus on the power amplifier it is provided on pin black plug while the weight on the pin of that plug fuse protection should be the value of a i did it a much a i have done installation bm supply shutting window separate fuse please see a description here http wwwclubnet showthreadphpost should still be interested in pin of the black plug it is connected to the radio to pin corresponding to a permit to run the amplifier something a la standby or remote otherwise writing turn on the radio turn on the amplifier turn the radio turn off the amplifier we need to connect the pin plug amplifier with pin section a radio plug figure below schematic pin plug for rb d when buying an amplifier got to set the plug into it what greatly helped me alteration talking with a friend from krakow cheer robert hinted at matching connector from something else but the ki a someone want i can call him and add it here now the question of assembly i thought a long time to solve the problem associated with placement of everything in the car and after a long deliberation i decided to mount the amplifier in the glove box i checked that it can not be damaged leg and hence the decision in addition i wa in this location close to the plugin radio leaf the assembly and pulling wire this contributed to the lowest possible interference in the wiring the need to perform a beam combining speaker output on the radio input of the amplifier amplifier output plug into speaker by doing it we can come back in a minute earlier call without repeater soon there will be some who find that the original wiring is to d sure they are partially right but if the factory radio ha an output power of approx w rms and this amp ha w rms so i see no need to change cable tedious and timeconsuming how do i know that the amplifier is w because like a real man i got under it and read the scalaczkw their name tdaq class b amplifier working in the bridge in the note directory you can read his power to be w thd and v power this power is available for each channel i will not elaborate on the power amplifier i refer eg here wwwalldatasheetpl datasheetpdf pdf philip tdaqhtml the amplifier ha system tdaq so we get scalak front l and p woofer scalak front l and p tweeter scalak back l and p broadband scalak back st and nd subwoofer amplifier jbl is not such a amplifier i have in addition to the power amplifier filter separating the frequency band of the specific type of speaker separated only the front and subwoofer pay attention to the output of the amplifier subwoofer it feed the subwoofer speaker consisting of two coil in one case speaker speaker double solenoid by the way i wonder if it would be proven design with two separate speaker in one enclosure with the structure and pattern that can not be like that connect the speaker a you want you need to connect them exactly a predicted manufacturer you would not get the effect you expect or even uszkodzimy amplifier speaker and yes the pin and and and are intended only for the subwoofer output a pin and and and are used only for output front tweeter there is no need to use crossover filter frequency division for specific speaker because they have done so already integrated in the amplifier the rear speaker are tweeter they must be equipped with capacitor odseparowujcy the bass usually do somewhere in the depth of the internet i found the characteristic of the amplifier jbl a you can see the producer already took care of the distribution of frequency and damping unfortunately in my sw missing pillar no place in the plug due to the established folding mirror so i had to tighten the tweeter additional cable using the upgrade connector onesteam purchased from your local electronics store for z pc those who do not have the option full electric mirror will not need it because they will have more space in the plug with the whole fuss with speaker cable is only tightening the wire to the subwoofer and whistle front subwoofer the number of wire two pair i chose to wire mm mounting leave already own creativity interested because of the banality of execution this connection is done by laying the cable in the original factory mount along the threshold of the car under the carpeted floor trivial solution and the easiest dismantle need only the lower part of the door seal and plastic in the middle column fastening of seat belt until the end of yet switched on the radio option output setting from the speaker to amp the program pp but here it is the pogadania i do not know what a miracle but i have two radio rd clarion which behave differently ie one set to have a speaker and the second the enhancer and then play both good but the change in their value on the contrary is both play quietly i do not know why i like it the same receiver i do not know whether zatrybicie to this translation of course i will not elaborate on the correct installation and caution and accuracy a well a for checking all across the stage adaptive audio system because i think the case is clear in this regard now matter subwoofer i made a chest size under the trunk so that it nicely komponowao a whole i measured the capacity of the factory for the subwoofer speaker and it came to me that is liter i made your subwoofer design matched to the sw and my thanks to the mm mdf board got a similar result well maybe a little bit bigger well that little boy still learning it helped me to calculate because thanks slant and tilt the side wall and the front it wa not a easy a an ordinary simple case and i wanted to know exactly how much a liter this project the hardest part wa i cut the wall plate with slant square meter board cost in koszalin approx pln enough wa enough in my project and still is the entire casing is made of a closed own so mad ni ma design chest leaned on several filmikach which are available on youtube the cut actually milled groove serve to mask the connection of material such a solution also found the net somehow it wa called but i do not remember how why housing closed because she can forgives many mistake all the wall are glued and screwed screw chose flathead because after drilling plate larger drill nicely hide and you can not feel the material inside and outside whole lakierowaem clear acrylic lacquer additionally the connection between the wall sealed with clear silicone veneer material blanket glued glue upholstery a you can see i wa able to choose even the color now a question of mounting the subwoofer a you can see in the picture below i chose to mount towards the left i do not remember why but i had to be a reason fixing the subwoofer is a little strange but unfortunately to date i have not found another important it work well to secure the speaker to be removed and whats next well you need to remove one of the mounting stud bacon and through this opening to postpone the screw that ha to go through accordingly to the drilled hole in the rear of the subwoofer after twisting the whole body is not going to fly the trunk of course the hole in the wall secured silicone then mount the speaker and grille what got actually thats probably not envy the wife of the original jbla anyway stated that the sw game somehow better the effect is probably worse than the ca for z but a i said with age but the hearing is deteriorating p such were the stage of the construction of the box i guess so jun http wwwclubnet showthreadphptpost,0
i woke up yesterday morning feeling vaguely depressed but until my husband nick wished me happy birthday i didnt realize this wa the day i turn year old i think i wa dreading this birthday partly because my mother died at her birth day wa feb mine is feb my mother died of congestive heart failure and actually outlived her doctor prediction by about a year so i drank my morning coffee and tried to sort out the jumble of thought and emotion this th birthday so close to the beginning of a new year wa definitely for me a liminal experience a daughter eleni would call it limen mean threshold in latin eleni studied anthropology in college and in her blog the liminal stage she explains liminal stage are psychological threshold time of transition when we stand betwixt and between one state and another the biggies are birth marriage deathcultures develop splashy ritual around these transition to ease the anxiety they provoke you can guess which liminal stage i wa contemplating in fact ive been talking so much about death in recent month that my kid and husband keep razzing me about it ive sent them memo about what i want and dont want at my funeral no open coffin in fact no body or casket funeral service for immediate family only some time later a party open house memorial service with no eulogy only extemporaneous anecdote with lot of food wine and music ive already worked out the entire mix of song i want heavy on led zeppelin and queen before her death my mother the world most organized person had written down the hymn and scripture reading for her funeral specified cremation and purchased the mausoleum niche where her ash and my father would be stowed in brass box that resemble book she chose a niche which had a view of the swan on the cemetery pond she had all their financial affair in order filed neatly in her desk when she died my father on the other hand had dementia a well a parkinson disease until he died at so he didnt even known when my mother died his dementia first became evident at our parent fiftieth wedding anniversary in when he wa about needle to say ive been watching myself for sign of alzheimers and avidly doing lumosity brain game every day daughter marina kindly signed me up knowing my worry about memory loss i realize a recent article have pointed out that lumosity doesnt really help you stave off dementia it just measure how you become better at the game with practice but nevertheless it gave me comfort that yesterday workout result put me at lpi whatever that is a compared with my age group and for problem solving but only for memory i wa happy that my number had gone up but then i realized that overnight the age group i wa being compared to had changed from age to to over le competition for the past fifty year or so ive been making pretty much the same new year resolution a everyone else lose ten pound go to the gym or pilate twice a week publish a book with my own name on it learn spanish so i can communicate better with my bilingual grandchild this year my new year resolution changed im no longer interested in improving my weight career or possession but still want to learn spanish all my resolution can be collected under the theme get rid of stuff i am a hoarder a my family will attest i even bought the best seller the lifechanging magic of tidying up by marie kondo but after reading several chapter i had to stop because it wa making me feel so guilty now im going to target certain areasmy studio my computer desk my makeup area the library and especially my closetsone at a time ton of paper have to go all those book ill never read again will be donated to the grafton library for sale all my officeappropriate clothes will go to dress for success so that other younger woman can find job ive told the kid whatever they want take it now in hope of avoiding a among my mother nine sibling bitter schism between two child who want the same antique bureau a the day of my th birthday moved from morose reflection over coffee to astonishment at the sight of over birthday wish on the internet i alternated between tear over the card my husband gave me and laughter for instance when daughter eleni posted on facebook did you know that on her th birthday i witnessed this woman sip from a hash milkshake in amsterdam trust me she wa in it for the milkshake happy birthday party girl i wa delighted to receive call and gift from son chris and daughter marina both on the opposite side of the country and chuckled at the book marina sent the alzheimers prevention program keep your brain alive and u for a grandma among them at the end of the day at dinner in the romantic restaurant casa tua in south beach fl nick and i told each other how lucky we are that weve made it through year of marriage that we have three great kid and two extraordinary grandchild and that when we get up in the morning no part of our body hurt thats a rare blessing when your age group is over so by the time the waiter brought a birthday crme brule with a candle in it a well a a chocolate meltdownboth surprise ordered by daughter eleni i felt ready to cross the threshold into the next liminal stage

a a newly minted psych np ill reiterate what horseshoe said above psych patient have medical issue and if you start a psych med that interacts with something they take for a medical condition or exacerbates that condition then thats your own malpractice and youre hurting the people youre supposed to help for instance i had a transgender patient who wa on an androgen blocker but couldnt remember the name they also had frequent nightmare my preceptor started them on prazosin which treat nightmare but is also a blood pressure medication the patient started fainting turn out they were on spironolactone which is an androgen blocker and a blood pressure med the patient wasnt harmed but could have been my experience in medsurg ha helped me avoid drug interaction or exacerbating someone heart failure or diabetes more time than i can count you could also work in psych a an rn and that would be beneficial it will allow you to observe psych symptom and recovery drug dosage side effect etc i worked inpatient psych while i wa in grad school specifically for that reason and it helped a lot now when i have a patient decompensating i can ask myself if they present like the patient i saw admitted to my inpatient unit and decide if i need to send them to the er or if i can safely treat them outpatient jun http allnursescom studentnursepractitioner howdoesworkingpagehtmlpost,0

blood flow to the lung artery is blocked suddenly due to a blood clot somewhere in the body including pulmonary embolism chronic thromboembolic disease pulmonary arterial hypertension pulmonary venoocclusive disease pulmonary arteriovenous malformation pulmonary edema etc pulmonary venoocclusive disease pvod is an extremely rare form of pulmonary hypertension affecting mostly in child and young adult a a result of a progressive obstruction of small pulmonary vein that lead to elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure the diagnosis patient in the early stage with early pulmonary venoocclusive disease pvod may experience no symptom at all but the progression of diseasse may attributable to pulmonary hypertension and rightsided heart failure supervene b noninvasive diagnosis to detect pvod a noninvasive diagnostic approach may include chest highresolution computed tomographymay be helpful for clinical differential diagnosis of pvod and pch in the study to examine chest hrct image for four patient with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ipah three patient with pvod and three patient with pch and to evaluate pulmonary vascular cast of lung tissue obtained from those patient at lung transplantation or autopsy found that measurement of the size of centrilobular ggos in hrct is a simple and useful method for clinical differential diagnosis of pvod and pch arterial blood gas analysis abg the aim of the blood withdrawn from an artery involving puncturing an artery with a thin needle and syringe is to determine the ph of the

complete evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history physical examination chest xray examination arterial blood gas analysis and test of pulmonary function bronchoalveolar lavage bronchoalveolar lavage ha a well established role in the diagnosis of pulmonary infection particularly those due to opportunistic organism in an immunocompromised host with an aim to as a number of pulmonary component of whchi may be useful in this regard particularly if combined with new method for examining inflammatory response such a those utilising the polymerase chain reaction to as cellular expression for inflammatory cytokine and growth factor transthoracic echocardiography transthoracic echocardiography is an important initial noninvasive diagnostic tool with aim to evaluate patient in whom pulmonary hypertension is suspected according to the accf aha expert consensus document on pulmonary hypertension flow cytometry pulmonary arterial hypertension pah and pulmonary venoocclusive disease pvod both display occlusive remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature responsible for increased pulmonary vascular resistance cytotoxic t ctl natural killer nk and natural killer t nkt cell play a critical role in vascular remodeling in different physiological and pathological condition according to study a decrease in gnly demethylation in the gdna extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cell and explanted lung wa found specifically in pvod but not in pah this wa associated with a decrease in population and subpopulation of ctl and nkt and an increase of nk population despite the reduced granulysincontaining cell in patient with pvod gnly serum level were higher suggesting these cell were wasting their content furthermore the increase of gnly concentration in the serum of pvod wa significantly higher than in patient with pah b surgical biopsy since surgical biopsy represents a highrisk procedure in these patient it is contraindicated lung biopsy or pathologic examination of pulmonary explants or postmortem lung sample however lung biopsy is hazardous in patient with severe pulmonary hypertension and there is a need for noninvasive

home remedy how to recognize a heart attack one month before it happens cardiovascular disease or cvd is the most dangerous killer nowadays it come with no warning well at least that is what you believe heart attack have several common symptom but most sufferer are not aware of these not until it is too latehowtorecognizeaheartattackonemonthbeforeithappens what is even worse there are patient who notice that something is wrong but they tend to overlook the problem and leave it without any proper treatment being aware and not doing anything is like a suicide here is a brief list of the most common sign and symptom of heart attack and heart disease in this way you will be able to recognize any strange symptom and treat them properly hopefully these will help you save your life in time dizziness and shortness of breath if you are not asthmatic or if you are not dealing with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease your inability to catch breath may indicate only a few thing and heart attack is one of them dizziness is also a common symptom of heart attack and cardiovascular ailment especially when it is accompanied with shortness of breath being constantly sick heart attack if usually announced through vomiting stomach ache indigestion or a general feeling of sickness chest pain chest pain is also a common symptom and luckily most people are aware of it meaning it may be triggered by various factor including muscle cramping lack of vitamin and mineral pulmonary disease and other the like medical expert explain that the pain that lead to a heart attack is usually located right under the breast bone or slightly in the left side of the center unusual ache ie neck pain similar to other medical condition an upcoming heart attack trigger pain in unrelated part in the body it may start off at the very center of the chest and then spread upwards the neck or the jaw some patient deal with severe and unbearable neck pain and ache in the jaw anxiety believe it or not anxiety can indicate a heart disease if your anxiety is accompanied with lightheadedness and even dizziness take special precaution because you might be dealing with a heart disease sicklike appearance blood pressure drop significantly prior a heart attack which is why most sufferer look pale and like they are about to faint palpitation irregular and fast heart rate followed by shortness of breath weakness and dizziness may be a sign of a sudden heart attack sometimes this symptom is associated with arrhythmia and heart failure consider treating this condition because when left untreated it may result in devastating healt problem tiredness weakness also a common symptom of an upcoming heart attack expert from the british heart foundation explain that woman are more likely to experience tiredness or weakness or both prior a heart attack sweating patient who have survived a heart attack remember being flooded in cold sweat before the attack had happened mar http hidupyieblogspotcom heartattacksignshtml,0
canadian journal of gastroenterology and hepatologyvolume article id page research article splitdose polyethylene glycol is superior to single dose for colonoscopy preparation result of a randomized controlled trial division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of calgary calgary ab canada department of medicine and community health science university of calgary calgary ab canada forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre alberta health service calgary ab canada division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of ottawa ottawa on canada received august accepted october copyright rachid mohamed et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative common attribution license which permit unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited abstract background the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormality within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation the objective of this study wa to compare the efficacy safety and tolerability of peg lavage and splitdose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon method the study wa a prospective randomized twoarm controlled trial of patient patient between the age of and year were referred to an outpatient university screening clinic for colonoscopy patient were allocated to receive either a single l peg lavage or a splitdose peg lavage result overall the bowel preparation wa superior in the splitdose group compared with the singledose group mean ottawa score versus and resulted in le overall fluid in the colon this effect wa observed across all segment of the colon assessed conclusion the current study support use of a splitdose peg lavage over a single large volume lavage for superior bowel cleanliness which may improve polyp detection this trial is registered with clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct introduction the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormality within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation despite advance in bowel preparation the process remains difficult for patient to tolerate and complete and ultimately if inadequate can result in missed lesion with published literature on missed polyp and carcinoma at colonoscopy optimal visualization of the colonic mucosa becomes critically important furthermore some evidence suggests that colonoscopy may not be protective against rightsided colonic lesion subtle flat lesion with a predilection for the proximal colon particularly those with serrated histology are becoming increasingly significant a potential factor for the lack of protection of colonoscopy proximally and stress the importance of adequate preparation background polyethylene glycol peg is a balanced electrolyte lavage rather than an osmotic agent therefore it use a a bowelcleansing preparation is typically associated with fewer fluid shift and electrolyte abnormality compared with low volume osmotic agent it ha been widely used for colonoscopy preparation on it own or in conjunction with other agent one disadvantage of the traditional l peg bowel preparation is a reduction in the quality of cleanliness with afternoon procedure which ha driven further research into timing and dosing of peg depending on timing of the procedure in our previous study the l peg preparation wa somewhat inferior to sodium phosphate preparation now removed from the market because it left a large amount of residual fluid in the colon however the use of a split dose of peg l the day before the procedure and l the morning of the procedure may alleviate some of the shortcoming of a single l preparation particularly for afternoon procedure the objective of this study wa to compare the efficacy and tolerability of single and splitdose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon and the influence of endoscopy time material and method all patient between the age of and year referred to the forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre in calgary alberta canada for colonoscopy in were considered for inclusion during preassessments at the clinic patient were asked to participate in the study by a nurse clinician those not interested in participating simply received the centre standard bowel preparation protocol patient with acute coronary syndrome congestive heart failure unstable angina known or suspected renal failure ascites megacolon known or suspected bowel obstruction or other comorbidities that may prevent colonoscopy were excluded patient were also excluded if they previously had a partial or subtotal colectomy or if the colonoscopy wa warranted for the evaluation of diarrhea enrollment of participant wa performed by a study coordinator a computer wa used to generate a randomization table with block of allocation concealment wa maintained through the use of consecutively numbered sealed envelope the allocation ratio wa colonoscopists and investigator were blinded to the allocation group patient were allocated to one of two group l peg the day before the procedure starting at noon for am procedure and pm for pm procedure or l of peg in a split dose procedure before am l at noon and l at pm the day before the procedure procedure after am l of peg at pm the day before the procedure and l of peg hour before the scheduled procedure time on the day of the procedure a study assistant assigned patient to their group and instructed them on the proper use of their assigned bowel preparation method patient were instructed to start a low residue diet day prior to the colonoscopy a table of acceptable food white bread white pasta dairy egg chicken beef pork fish cooked or steamed vegetable and canned fruit and food to avoid whole grain brown or wild rice oatmeal raw fruit and berry any food containing nut seed and popcorn wa included in the patient handout patient were instructed to take a light breakfast on the morning before the procedure followed by clear fluid thereafter patient were given a tolerability questionnaire that wa modified from a previously reported questionnaire to be completed once their bowel preparation wa finished and before coming to the hospital for the colonoscopy patient concern or question regarding the preparation were directed to the assistant a opposed to their gastroenterologist so a to avoid unblinding the gastroenterologist outcome the previously validated ottawa bowel preparation scale wa used to as the quality of bowel cleanliness each of the right mid and rectosigmoid colon wa rated on a point scale in addition overall colonic fluid wa assessed with a point rating resulting in an overall score range of to an excellent preparation with little fluid would have a score of to and a good preparation would have a score of to an adequate bowel preparation would have a score of or lower and a completely unprepared colon would have a score of to depending on the amount of colonic fluid colonoscopy wa performed in a standard fashion and endoscopists rated the bowel preparation quality during the procedure before any attempt to improve visualization and recorded the result on a separate standardized form secondary outcome included a tolerability questionnaire a well a patient and investigator reported adverse event statistical analysis descriptive statistic were used for baseline characteristic the ottawa bowel preparation scale produce data that are approximately normally distributed twogroup anova wa used to as for the presence of group difference in the preparation score while accounting for procedure time am versus pm the proportion of adequate bowel preparation in each group wa compared with a chi square statistic the secondary endpoint of tolerability were assessed using the mannwhitney test sample size calculation in our previous study using the ottawa bowel preparation scale an observed effect size of wa seen for a twogroup anova a total sample size of patient would be required for a twotailed alpha at and an power based on experience from our previous study an additional of patient were added to the total sample size to account for early withdrawal and incomplete colonoscopy result in total patient were enrolled in the study in the splitdose group and in the singledose group completed the study patient in the singledose group and patient in the splitdose group discontinuation were due to scheduling conflict no adverse event causing discontinuation were reported table show the baseline characteristic of the two group there were no significant difference between group in the splitdose group underwent afternoon colonoscopy compared with in the singledose group table baseline characteristic of the patient the difference in ottawa score between the two group are illustrated in figure in total the bowel preparation wa superior in the splitdose group compared with the singledose group mean ottawa score versus splitdose peg resulted in a lower and therefore better mean ottawa score across all segment of the colon assessed a well a le overall fluid in the colon this reached statistical significance for the total right and left colon furthermore the splitdose group had a higher proportion of patient with adequate bowel preparation ottawa score than the singledose group versus figure figure ottawa bowel prep score for splitdose and singledose peg lavage group by colon segment and overall lower score are better figure proportion of patient with adequate bowel preparation ottawa bowel prep score for splitdose and singledose peg lavage group split preparation for morning procedure were performed only for those procedure after am a earlier procedure were not feasible to have patient take an early morning dose of their preparation in procedure performed in the morning the splitdose peg lavage resulted in a lower total ottawa score compared with the singledose lavage mean total ottawa score versus the ottawa score in the right colon wa significantly better in the splitdose group than in the singledose group versus the difference in ottawa score between the two group for morning procedure are illustrated in table table mean ottawa score parameter for morning procedure the effect of the splitdose lavage compared with the singledose lavage is amplified in the afternoon procedure the total ottawa score wa far superior in the splitdose arm versus a were the independent assessment of the different colonic region right colon versus mid colon versus left colon versus all the difference in total ottawa score with the splitdose and singledose peg lavage for both morning and afternoon procedure are illustrated in figure figure bowel preparation quality for am earlier than am and pm after am procedure all singledose patient took their bowel preparation l peg the day before the colonoscopy starting at noon for am procedure and pm for pm procedure splitdose patient took the second dose the evening before colonoscopy for am procedure or hour before the colonoscopy time for pm procedure both preparation were generally well tolerated and completed a directed by the majority of participant in splitdose group versus in singledose group question regarding tolerability of the lavage preparation are shown in table more patient who took the single l lavage would rather have had a different preparation method compared with those who took the split dosing the mean number of adverse event experienced during the lavage wa higher in the singledose group compared with the splitdose group versus adverse event data are provided in table table questionnaire patient opinion regarding the assigned bowel preparation table adverse event group symptom score discussion administration of a peg lavage in two l do is superior to administration in a single l dose for screening colonoscopy in an outpatient population the result is an overall better cleanliness in all region of the colon a well a le residual fluid while this hold true for procedure performed throughout the day the effect is amplified when there is a shorter interval between the last dose of peg and the procedure a wa the case in the afternoon procedure where the second peg dose wa given in the morning of the day of the procedure in this situation the difference in total ottawa score between the splitdose and singledose preparation wa the greatest while there wa still a significant difference in morning procedure where the last peg dose wa given the evening before the effect wa le dramatic this begs the question a to whether patient with morning procedure should be asked to take the second peg dose hour before the procedure rather than the evening before at least in the setting of colorectal cancer screening clearly this put a significant added burden on patient with scheduled morning procedure there are a variety of reason a to why a splitdose administration of peg is superior to a singledose administration the second dose of the split preparation is given closer to the procedure time than is the single dose the result is likely a better removal of fluid and debris that may have accumulated in the hour since the first dose of the peg lavage the single dose of peg is almost always given the night before the procedure leaving several hour since the laxative wa administered for fluid bile and debris to accumulate therefore the bowel becomes le clean over time matro and colleague have recently shown equivalency for morning only and a splitdose peg preparation pm am for afternoon procedure suggesting that the earlier dose may not even be required another study found that maximal cleanliness of the bowel preparation wa achieved when the colonoscopy were performed within hour of the last laxative dose this notion is supported in our study by the superior bowel preparation in the afternoon procedure the effect wa le pronounced in the morning procedure likely because of the increased time between the second dose evening before and the colonoscopy time in our study afternoon procedure case received the second dose of peg hour priorly a better bowel preparation ha been associated with higher cecal intubation rate and higher polyp detection rate in a study by marmo et al a splitdose peg lavage outperformed a singledose peg lavage for colonoscopy the improved bowel preparation were associated with a fold increase in cecal intubation and a fold increase in adenoma detection the superiority of the splitdose lavage in the right colon shown in this study and others facilitates better identification of the serrated adenoma which tend to be flat and more difficult to detect polyp and adenoma detection rate are typically descr apr http wwwhindawicom journal cjgh,0

invc news new delhi world leading cardio and endovascular technology maker biotronik today introduced in india it latest and most advanced home monitoring technology for patient with implanted cardiac device such a pacemaker implantable defibrillator icds and heart failure device biotronik home monitoring is an internet based remote monitoring technology that enables physician to continuously and reliably monitor their patient clinical and device status anytime anywhere and minimize risk of any negative medical event the latest device in the biotronik home monitoring program the cardiomessenger smart is about the size of a smartphone and is highly robust more convenient and remarkably portable a compared to previous version of the device having the pacemaker wearer constantly connected to their physician this home monitoring technology enhances safety for cardiac device patient the device provides fully automatic transmission of vital information from a patient cardiac implant to their physician via biotronik home monitoring data are transmitted from the patient implant to the cardiomessengers transmitter device which u tmobile and it partner network gprs to send data to the biotronik service centre from where the data is sent to the physician home monitoring ha helped doctor world over to keep a very close look at their patient implanted device and their cardiac activity it ha helped reduced mortality episode of hospitalization and inappropriate shock and helped improve the quality of life of patient immensely it help use of the full potential of the device that preserve battery life it ha also helped reduce routine clinic follow up which can be a burden to patient and extra workload for physician these result formed basis for the class i a indication which mean this is considered a standard of best care this wa the recommendation by the heart rhythm society and is endorsed by the other professional society around the world including asia pacific heart rhythm society said dr niraj varma electrophysiologist at cleveland clinic ohio usa who cochaired this document dr varma say home monitoring ha clinically shown to have helped doctor provide improved service and helped better the health condition of patient the cardiomessenger smart facilitates the application of home monitoring result from large clinical show the following benefit of home monitoring mortality in heart patient le by hospitalization due to atrial arrhythmia or stroke le by inoffice follow ups le by risk of inappropriate shock in patient with implanted device le by another advantage of constant remote monitoring is that we a physician get a closer look at trend in different patient some patient might have a more stable heart activity with a cardiac device others may have more frequent discrepancy and episode of arrhythmia by regular monitoring data over a period of time we can understand each patient and tailor our treatment and advice according to their need and optimise device function it also help better our medical understanding and give vital data for research regular monitoring of patient wearing pacemaker and other device ha traditionally been a cumbersome task since patient are required to visit clinic at regular interval in a country like india where a patient from bihar might have had a device implanted in delhi follow up visit can be very difficult sometimes a medical event in between the visit could go unnoticed and be life threatening to the patient home monitoring ha made it easy enhanced safety and also reduced cost said dr viveka kumar senior consultant interventional cardiologist director of the cath lab at max hospital new delhi biotronik home monitoring is the only remote monitoring system worldwide with u fda and european ce approval to replace conventional inoffice follow ups and provide early detection of clinically relevant cardiac event it is the only system with fully automated data transmission no patient interaction is needed leading to the highest possible patient compliance physician can define the event they wish to be notified with via email sm or fax and view the event in order of importance regular data recording allows significant trend analysis help physician understand each patient condition and adjust their treatment accordingly the process also allows better scheduling of followup appointment which may be skipped if not needed digital technology ha drastically changed the way we live and it impact on healthcare is also profoundly visible today the indian government special emphasis on digital india show how it and digitization is inextricably linked to development digitization is bringing revolutionary change to healthcare delivery across the world including use of telemedicine to reach out to patient in remote area and make diagnosis result quicker at biotronik we believe that digital technology can be effectively used to benefit a large number of patient biotronik home monitoring system are leveraging this technology not only to improve healthcare delivery but also radically improve the quality of life of our patient cardiomessenger is the latest manifestation of how digital technology can benefit heart patient and help them live longer more productive life said mr tushar basu managing director biotronik india clinical study have shown home monitoring make patient feel more secure improving their quality of life of patient surveyed said it gave them a sense of security while believed it had a positive impact on their health mar http

hopkins hospital and ronald berger md phd professor of professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at john hopkins university if youve ever run up a flight of stair chased a tennis ball across the court or reacted in fright at a scary movie you know what a pounding heart feel like but for the million american who suffer from atrial fibrillation af or afib a racing heart is a way of life simple task like getting out of bed in the morning or rising from a chair can cause dizziness weakness shortness of breath or heart palpitation for these people af severely impairs quality of lifeand even when symptom stemming from af are mild the disorder can seriously impact health increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure af can be a debilitating even deadly condition fortunately it can be successfully managedbut there are various approach for treating af or preventing a recurrence how do you and your doctor choose which approach is right for you if you or a loved one ha af there are so many question do i need an anticoagulant should i be taking medication to control my heart rate will my symptom respond to cardioversion if i need an antiarrhythmic drug to control af episode which one should i take when is an ablation procedure appropriate and more it critically important to learn everything you can nowso you can partner with your doctor effectively ask the right question and understand the answer to help you we asked two eminent expert to share their expertise and handson experience with arrhythmia patient in an important special health report atrial fibrillation the

service the electrophysiology lab and the atrial fibrillation center at the john hopkins hospital he ha clinical and research interest in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia with catheter ablation the role of device therapy for treating ventricular arrhythmia the evaluation and management of syncope and the study of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia dr calkin ha authored more than manuscript and book chapter and he is a member of the editorial board of five major cardiology journal he wa lead author of the and hr ehra ecas consensus document on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation and more recently he wa a member of the writing committee for the updated atrial fibrillation guideline issued jointly in by the american college of cardiology the american heart association and the heart rhythm society in dr calkin served a president of the heart rhythm society an international organization of more than specialist in heart rhythm disorder dr ronald berger md phd a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at john hopkins university is director of the electrophysiology fellowship program and codirector of the electrophysiology service at the john hopkins hospital he serf on the editorial board of three major journal in the cardiovascular field ha authored more than article and book chapter and hold over patent on method and device used in electrophysiology diagnosis and treatment along with dr hugh calkin dr berger and his colleague perform approximately electrophysiology procedure and atrial fibrillation ablation procedure each year recently there have been important revision to clinical practice guideline for managing af atrial fibrillation the latest management strategy make use of these new guideline to provide you with current information on the newest drug treatment and research data i feel like my heart is going to jump out of my chest an arrhythmia is an abnormality in the timing or pattern of the heartbeat causing the heart to beat too rapidly too slowly or irregularly sound pretty straightforward but there a lot we dont know about why the heart rhythm go awry or the best way to treat it in atrial fibrillation the latest management strategy we focus on what we do know in page after page of this comprehensive report we address your most serious concern about living with af such a i dont have any symptom is my problem definitely afcan drinking alcohol trigger or worsen af what about extra weightis every person who ha af at risk for a strokeif my doctor suspect af will i have to wear an implantable or event monitor to be surewhy doe af often show up later in lifewhat would you recommend to the older patient and olderwho ha af but no bothersome symptomswhat do you recommend for the person with longstanding persistent afis the af experienced by an otherwise healthy person different from that of a person with underlying heart disease or other health issueswhat are the difference among paroxysmal af persistent af and longstanding persistent afwhat option are available for controlling my af symptomswhat if antiarrhythmic medication fails to suppress af episode anticoagulation therapy what you should know while af is generally not life threatening for some patient it can increase the likelihood of blood clot forming in the heart and if a clot travel to the brain a stroke

in surgery there have been certain period when advancement in knowledge and technical invention have had a marked effect on our life and the surgeon ability two quantum leap occurred in the late th century which together allowed the transition to modern surgery the first great advancement wa the discovery and use of anesthesia especially ether to enable the surgeon to work without causing pain and the inevitable accompanying shock which would be life threatening subsequent new agent and newer delivery method have eliminated the bad effect of the original drug an appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic technique in surgery antisepsis which soon gave way to asepsis reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous era the next major advancement wa a the result of the spanish civil war when an understanding of shock and it treatment in traumatic injury proved to be lifesaving in the post wwii era starting in the late a combination of better anesthesia technique and shock support plus a better understand of the body hemostasis led to greater surgical advance to the point where we can now even transplant organ included in these advancement were the use of new visual tool a well a the computer and microsurgical development so called noninvasive the first heart valve replacement happen in the s it wa a rather brutal procedure and took a such a great toll on the body that the majority who needed the operation the most especially the elderly over had little chance of surviving the operation i am unawares of anyone in the being offered the procedure the operation wa done by splitting the sternum breast bone down the middle then the heart is exposed the pericardium is opened and the patient is put on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine also known a the heartlung machine this machine take over the task of breathing for the patient and pumping their blood around while the surgeon replaces the heart valve before it invention the heart continued to beat and made it difficult to place the valve a further advancement wa the addition of the use of hypothermia lowering the body temperature early adoption of this technique proceeded slowly based on the limitation of available replacement valve and relatively primitive technique for protecting the heart during surgery which were available at the time with the evolution of mechanical heart valve and gradual development in cardiopulmonary bypass the heart lung machine and cardioplegia which allow the heart to be stopped safely during surgery aortic valve replacement became accepted therapy for patient with severe aortic insufficiency and or regurgitation once the patient is on bypass a cut is made in the aorta and a cross clamp applied the surgeon then remove the patient diseased aortic valve and a mechanical or tissue valve is put in it place once the valve is in place and the aorta ha been closed the patient is taken off the heartlung machine transesophageal echocardiogram tee an ultrasound of the heart done through the esophagus can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly pacing wire are usually put in place so that the heart can be manually paced should any complication arise after surgery drainage tube are also inserted to drain fluid from the chest and pericardium following surgery these are usually removed within hour while the pacing wire are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital recovery from this operation usually take about month or more a medical procedure evolved cardiac cauterization became standard and not only could the heart blood vessel be visualized but the placing of stent instead of open heart coronary heart surgery became possible and a common treatment in only year ago the first aortic valve wa replaced by using a catheter inserted through the femoral artery and passed into the heart hospitalization wa now no more than day if there were no complication which were much le than in open heart replacement now those in the could be treated instead of facing rapid progress heart failure within a week or two the patient could depending on his heir status resume normal life these valve folded up so that they could be passed through the catheter and were then open when in the area of the valve to be replaced and anchored into position they consisted of a metal framework covered with a plastic and the valve itself wa usual from pig tissue the metal frame help anchor the valve in place the operation is called trans aortic valve replacement tavr today a new and better valve for many reason is undergoing clinical trial in the usa although it ha been in use in europe for about year it ha no metal and is secured in place by expanding it a if it were a balloon and then hardening polymer is injected to fix it in place if the surgeon doe not like it initial positioning he deflates the balloon and reposition it under the ultrasound and fluoroscope guidance before injecting the fixing agent it will be only be a matter of time when all valve replacement will be done by this le traumatic method apr http dpotpourriblogspotcom ofhearthtml,0

re anyone take blood pressure medication mv quote but cant see how stress can harden the artery and make it harder to pump annoys me because a i said ive always prided myself on being in shape but feel like i backed a genetic loser here think of it this way your blood pressure represents in one respect the force your heart ha to overcome to push blood around your body this isnt a bad thing if it intermittent for example when your blood pressure is higher during exercise but if it that appears to predispose a person to damage their blood vessel leading to atherosclerosis and it also can lead to an enlarged diseased heart and ultimately heart failure your blood pressure is the product of cardiac output how much blood is being pumped and total peripheral resistance in essence the volume of blood vessel the blood is being pushed through stress induces a sympathetic nervous system response in your body that increase cardiac output by causing your heart to beat faster and harder and cause vasoconstriction around the body which lower the volume of the tube for the blood to travel through thereby increasing total peripheral resistance hence it increase blood pressure and yes a lot of high blood pressure ha nothing to do with lifestyle feb http wwwforumslowtwitchcom forum slowtwitchforumsc lavenderroomf gforumcgipost,0

clean eating is about being aware of the food choice you are making and looking for simple healthy option it mean consuming plenty of vegetable fruit whole grain and healthy protein and fat and opting for organic nongmo food whenever possible let explore in more detail why clean eating is so important and look at tip for eating clean that can immediately begin transforming your relationship with food cut back on added sugar american consume a shocking amount of added sugar every day on average adult take in teaspoon ounce of added sugar which equates to around calorie to help you visualize ounce is around the size of a deck of card of sugar every day most added sugar is consumed in the form of soft drink the many different kind of sugar additive in processed food and candy cake cooky pie and pastry sugar add calorie to food while contributing zero nutritional value aside from energy carbohydrate a highsugar diet is linked to obesity metabolic syndrome insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes hypoglycemia heart disease high blood pressure depression gout headache fatigue it important to be mindful of the amount of sugar in the food you are eating a well a the type of sugar it also help to eat food with good amount of fiber a it slows the body absorption of sugar limiting consumption of highly processed added sugar is an essential part of clean eating distinguishing between natural and added sugar in prepared food can be confusing for consumersthats why some consumer group are petitioning the food and drug administration fda to require disclosure of added sugar on nutrition label how much is okay the world health organization who recommends no more than teaspoon gram of added sugar a day ditch refined grain refined grain are le nutritious because they have been stripped of their bran and germthe most fibrous part of the plant a in fruit the fiber in grain is what slows the absorption of sugar when blood sugar level rise too quickly the result is a spike in insulin which over time can increase your risk of diabetes there ha been a lot of backlash against the idea that refined grain are le healthy especially white rice but we stand firmwhole grain are simply the healthier choice choose whole grain like whole wheat steel cut or rolled oat brown rice quinoa amaranth flax and barley watch salt intake american consume far more salt on average than the recommended mg maximum per day sodium easily hide in packaged food sometimes in surprising quantity read nutrition label carefully and choose wisely when seasoning homemade food start with herb spice citrus and vinegarand then add salt you might be surprised at how much salt you add to food while cooking a highsodium diet can lead to high blood pressure stroke heart disease heart failure choose minimallyprocessed food all food ha been processed to some extenteven fresh fruit and vegetable must be harvested cleaned and in some case polished before they make it to your local market how do you know a food ha been minimally processed a good rule of thumb is to choose packaged food and healthy snack with ingredient you can pronounce a fruit and nut bar that contains ingredient like date cherry almond and walnut in other word easily identifiable ingredientsis a good choice avoid heavily processed food with a laundry list of ingredient especially unrecognizable one pick your fat wisely in year past dietary fat had a bad rap the lowfat craze led to fat being removed from packaged food only to be replaced by sugar which a we discussed above is not a good substitute today we know that not all fat are created equal and that good fat the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated variety are essential for health industrialmade fat including trans fat should be avoided trans fat are a byproduct of hydrogenation which involves forcing hydrogen molecule into oil to turn it into a solid at room temperature and prevent rancidity good for shelf life bad for your artery on food label youll typically see trans fat a hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil these fat increase your bad ldl lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol which can clog artery and lead to a host of health problem what about saturated fat these are mostly solid at room temperature and are found in food like red meat butter whole milk and palm oil american generally consume more saturated fat than they should although whether saturated fat are bad for u is still hotly contested the latest report released by the world health organization ha linked processed meat with an increased cancer risk your best bet is opting for product that contain expeller pressed or cold pressed vegetable oil and better yet monounsaturated oil from avocado nut and nut butter olive and high oleic variety sunflower oil increase vegetable intake pile those veggie onto your plate most of u dont get enough vegetable every day the usda recommends cup of vegetable per day for woman and cup per day for men but go ahead and eat morewe dare you it easier than you think dress your sandwich with lettuce and tomato whip up a veggiefruit smoothie after a workout tuck a bag of baby carrot in your bag and up the amount of veggie in your stir fry there are a myriad of way to increase your daily intake of veggie cut back on the booze i cook with wine sometimes i even add it to the food wc field most of u by now have heard the report that moderate alcohol consumption may help protect against cardiovascular disease this is because moderate level of alcohol increase level of highdensity lipoprotein hdl our good cholesterol the problem come in defining what constitutes moderate drinkingwhether it one drink per day or three is contested even among alcohol researcher here are some good rule to follow stay within the recommended one drink per day for woman or two for men avoid binge drinking sorry folk imbibing your weekly allotment of adult beverage on a saturday night isnt part of a moderate drinking program just say no to fruity drink loaded with sugar cut back on meat and dairy most american eat far more meat and dairy than is recommended by the usda many of u dont know what our daily protein need are which is part of the problem the average woman need just gram of protein a day while a man need around gram a day thats le than two ounce a sixounce steak contains a much protein a a woman need for an entire day but that same sixounce steak come with increased risk from carcinogen and saturated fat unlike other source of protein such a bean pea lentil nut grain and even some leafy green vegetable weve been told since we were little to drink our milk for strong bone but many might be surprised to learn that dairy may actually leach calcium from bone and threequarters of the world is lactose intolerant best to cut back on meat and dairy consumption and up alternative source of protein like bean nut and proteinpacked veggie and grain up your fruit intake it a common misconception that we should limit our fruit intake because fruit contains sugar in our first tip we explained the importance of the fructosetofiber ratio the fiber content in fruit help the body absorb sugar more slowly so go ahead indulge in daily do of delicious fruitiness and dont forget that all natural snack like fruit bar made from fruit juice and puree count toward your daily fruit intake drink more water water is essential for every single one of our bodily function it also flush toxin from the body plain water is the best option for staying hydrated but fruit and vegetable with high water content such a watermelon lettuce and tomato can also help you stay hydrated your water need can vary dramatically depending on the season and your level of physical activity but at a minimum strive for that is eight oz glass a day use this hydration calculator to determine your specific hydration need eating clean is about taking control of your health and understanding how our industrialized

memory taken by alzheimers could possibly be retrieved paracetamol useless in treating osteoarthritis pain paracetamol is next to useless at alleviating arthritic pain the time report a comprehensive review of existing data suggests paracetamol should not be used in case of osteoarthritis a there are far more effective treatment available osteoarthritis is now the leading cause of joint pain and stiffness in older people the review showed that paracetamol at any dose had a very low chance of improving pain linked to osteoarthritis chance despite being advised a the painkiller of first choice in current guidance in contrast the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid class of painkiller such a diclofenac mg per day and etoricoxib or mg per day were found more likely to improve pain between and likely and were the topranked painkilling drug a potential drawback to nsaid is that longterm use can trigger complication such a stomach ulcer and in rarer case heart failure if a person is thought to be at risk of stomach ulcer additional protective medication such a proton pump inhibitor may also be prescribed nice the uk health watchdog which issue guidance to doctor is in the process of updating it guidance on drug management of osteoarthritis therefore it is likely that this latest study will feed into the process if you have concern speak to your doctor do not change prescribed medication without consulting your doctor first not doing so may damage your health lifestyle change such a losing weight and regular exercise can also help relieve symptom of osteoarthritis university in switzerland and canada and wa funded by the swiss national science foundation and arco foundation many of the researcher involved in the project reported that they were employed by or had received grant from pharmaceutical company the study wa published medical journal the lancet the uk medias report were generally accurate but largely ignored the good news about nsaid and instead focused on debating whether paracetamol should be used for arthritic pain this is a reasonable line to take due to the large number of people who use paracetamol to relieve arthritis pain both in the uk and around the world wa a metaanalysis of randomised control trial rcts looking at how effective different drug were to help lower pain linked to osteoarthritis osteoarthritis is a condition that cause the joint to become painful and stiff it is the most common type of arthritis in the uk there is no cure for osteoarthritis but it can be effectively managed the main treatment for osteoarthritis include lifestyle measure such a maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly medication to relieve your pain including paracetamol and supportive therapy to help make everyday activity easier the analysis found decent sized rcts with over people comparing different nsaid or paracetamol with a placebo to improve osteoarthritic pain how well the drug improved joint movement wa also assessed included nsaid that are available in the uk were ibuprofen celecoxib commonly called a cox inhibitor etoricoxib commonly called a cox inhibitor the analysis also included rofecoxib and lumiracoxib both of which have been withdrawn from the uk market due to safety concern in total people were included in the analysis average median follow up wa week with a large range from one week to one year the researcher used a statistical technique called network metaanalysis this allows direct and indirect comparison of drug for example if one study compared paracetamol with a placebo and a second compared an nsaid with placebo in similar condition this technique allows you to estimate the probability that paracetamol work better than the nsaid including these indirect comparison is useful but not a accurate a trial directly comparing one drug with another sometimes called headtohead trial this review included both direct and indirect comparison the final output wa a rank of all the nsaid paracetamol and placebo and an estimate of their ability to achieve a minimum clinically important difference in pain the minimum difference wa defined at a set point reduction standard deviation within the overall spread of pain reduction for each trial etoricoxib mg or mg and diclofenac mg per day the maximum dose were very likely to improve pain between and likely and were the topranked nsaid the withdrawn drug rofecoxib wa also similarly ranked the bottom of the ranking table wa filled with different do of paracetamol for example the highestranked paracetamol dose g per day wa linked to only a chance of helping pain to a useful level do le than g had only a chance of helping pain ranking second to last behind naproxen mg concluded on the basis of the available data we see no role for singleagent paracetamol for the treatment of patient with osteoarthritis irrespective of dose they added we provide sound evidence that diclofenac mg day is the most effective nsaid available at present in term of improving both pain and function nevertheless in view of the safety profile of these drug physician need to consider our result together with all known safety information when selecting the preparation and dose for individual patient conclusion this swiss study reviewed drug commonly used and recommended to help pain associated with osteoarthritis through indirect comparison it identified those likely to be most effective diclofenac mg day and those that are pretty likely to be useless paracetamol any dose the study looked at a large number of goodsized rcts all with more than people and covered a useful range of nsaid the quality of the rcts wa also assessed and wa generally not highly biased although variable however the review included many indirect comparison of the drug which is le accurate and reliable than direct comparison but without more direct comparison available this is probably the best we have to go on for now the main implication from the study author point of view wa clear paracetamol ha no place in the pain management of osteoarthritis on it own this finding jar with the uk current national guidance that advocate using paracetamol a a firstchoice painkiller alongside other osteoarthritis management the fact paracetamol might not be useful in the pain management of osteoarthritis doe appear to be recognised by nice the watchdog that issue guidance on medicine although the current guidance based on recommendation advocate it use for example nice report that it is in the process of updating the guidance and hint that paracetamol may be le effective than thought in nice make a point of saying on it website that an evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol a part of a consultation exercise showed reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what wa previously thought the current guideline on pain management in osteoarthritis is due to be updated in september in the meantime if you have concern about taking paracetamol for pain linked to osteoarthritis consult your doctor before changing your medication it is also important not to overlook the benefit that lifestyle change such a achieving a healthy weight and becoming more active can bring read more about how exercise and weight loss can help prevent future flareup of arthritis symptom

spell man if you want to express your opinion ok however the medical literature is replete with the problem of drug penetration in regard to cancer please do not think your opinion overrules the problem i could go on and on here the problem of leukemia that occurs some time after chemotherapy a cancer patient need to begin searching for alternative whether they choose chemo or not after chemo what keep cancer from returning since chemo doe not address the cause then there is the heart failure after chemo and chemo brain where there are thinking problem and the destruction of the immune system there is no good reason to tout chemotherapy modern effort are to develop therapy that boost immunity that address epigenetic mechanism that are le toxic the diff here willy is my opinion is an expert opinion your opinion is just that an opinion you really have nothing to add except question thats fine you have nothing to teach mar http wwwamazoncom forum healthcdforumfxeokzgfcbcdpagecdthreadtxeobmbxhdxkmxzuawbmfhkg,0

i guess you could say were going back to the future return to tomorrow wa published in towards the tail end of hubbard golden age pulp writer period but before his criminal cult leader period began in earnest it actually debuted four year earlier a to the star a twopart story in the monthly astounding science fiction which is why the only wikipedia page for return to tomorrow refers to a star trek episode and i think this mean that the book cover is lying to me when it claim this story is an ace book original novel never before published not even an asterisk explaining a a complete story to cover their ass a you can see from that cover this here a vintage scifi story weve got classic rocket ship landed on their tail end weve got sleek weapon that can only be ray gun and weve got useless fin on the helmet of the space suit which i refer to with sarcastic quotation mark because the thing dont even have glove at least put on some mitten dearie space is cold our story hook on the back cover is shanghaied into eternity our protagonist alan corday is doomed to be captured by a captain jocelyn to crew a spaceship since not even wealth and woman were sufficient to fill his crew vacancy thats because of the terrible price you pay for sailing between world which will be elaborated on later so were due for a mutiny swashbuckling pirate and the acrid fume of a war of annihilation a mr corday try to get home also im tickled that woman is listed a a lure to entice sailor you there strapping young lad would you like to leave your old life behind and sign on for month of labor inside a cold steel shell wrapped in the colder void of space possibly to never see your home world again no you might get laid ive reconsidered but what is this fearsome price that all star sailor must pay perhaps the prologue will elaborate space is deep man is small and time is his relentless enemy do we have to be so disparaging cant we say that man is big but space is just bigger in an ancient and forgotten age the early th century he first discovered the barricade before space travel first began he knew the barricade wa there it wa an equation without the equation the basic equation of mass and time man could not have progressed beyond barbaric fire er i think we had at least made it to the medieval age maybe even the industrial era before busting out this particular physic equation but he did progress oh well objection withdrawn then i mean if you are going to immediately contradict yourself and he used fission and his mechanicians did you mean machination became mighty and his hope large but the term of his salvation were the term of his imprisonment a well a mass approach infinity time approach zero ah i see a man sits on the couch and eats microwave dinner he gain weight exponentially but his time run out and he dy of heart failure the narrator credit this equation to lortentz and fitzgerald and especially a theoretical philosopher named einstein with the power of this equation that man fellow wa able to colonize the solar system yet at the same time it almost denied to him the star and by almost i mean didnt and yet despite the difficulty derived by these great men and confirmed first by nuclear physicist and then by actual use there were still those who accepted and yet defied the law a small cohort of ship and men who throughout the age have kept the route alive the outcast and pariah of extraatmosphere travel the cursed and shunned by man they course their lonely way farbound but prisoner too shackled fast by time knowing well their waiting fate who would volunteer to become part of that thin group er the outcast and pariah those cursed and shunned by but amongst the society of man there are always those who are outcast from character or force of circumstance and there are adventurer who will not heed equation and so the star were reached and partially explored despite the fact of those who made the run this narrator is going to keep answering his own question by repeating information he gave before asking them also my hunch is thats supposed to be despite the fate of those who made the run but let get down to the brass tack whatever those are these outcast take whats called the long passage to place like alpha centauri which a spaceship can reach in six week sometimes theyre earnest adventurer sometimes theyre criminal and fugitive trying to evade capture at any rate if they ever get back to their port of origin theyll find it irrevocably changed because while it a sixweek voyage for them many year will have passed planetside this can be a bit inconvenient he who is gone for a century cannot well return he know too little his people are dead he ha no place and he doe not fit and what may have begun a an adventure for a crew invariably ended in the same way another passage out while behind them further age accumulated while the crew stayed young the only fraternity wa within the ship the only hope wa that some day someone might discover another equation a solution to the barricade a mass approach the speed of light time approach zero the outcast of the long passage those that stayed alive never ceased to hope see this is a story about time dilation and true to form the author is muddling it up a ive said before my career in hard science wa cut short by some bad experience in high school so im not the most qualified person to discus this topic but a far a ive been able to piece together the idea go like this the faster youre moving compared to another frame of reference the le time seems to pa for you by their standard on your spaceship zipping around at warp whatever you wouldnt notice anything weird but if you went back to earth youd find that your ship clock marked le time on your voyage than what your departure and return time on earth would indicate thus flying around at high speed is a form of oneway onlyforward time travel a for where mass enters his equation err i think hubbard latched on to the notion of relativistic mass but i dont think this actually mean you get bigger or anything a you approach lightspeed and the time approach zero bit is also perplexing since it would imply that what a you move fast you get bigger and then stop moving at all it probably better to ignore this cruel equation altogether and just keep in mind that week aboard a spaceship can equal year for your family back home except it sound like this story is going to be about trying to find a breakthrough new equation this could be problematic a story based on solving a misunderstanding of advanced physic apr http missionsporkblogspotcom returntotomorrowintrophysicsishtml,0

hi winchester and welcome to the forum i am surprised that doctor still prescribe actos in addition to some scary side effect it even carry a black box warning concerning the possibiity of causing or worsening congestive heart failure you are right to be wary of this drug imo it is a dangerous drug usually a sulfonylurea drug glyburide glimepiride or glipizide is given if metformin alone wont sufficiently lower your blood glucose imo if metformin and a sulfonylurea wont do the trick than you are better off on insulin than taking a dangerous drug in my estimation most of the newer drug have dangerous side effect here is an article showing the side effect of actos http wwweverydayhealthcom drug pioglitazone just tell your doctor that you will not take a drug with a black box warning or one with dangerous side effect jul http communitydiabetesorg t adultslivingwithtype actos mp highlight truem,0

march am edt current clinical trial are evaluating stem cell therapy for condition ranging from eye disease to aid discovery in stem cell science over the past decade are finally starting to reach the clinic current clinical trial are evaluating stem cell therapy for condition ranging from eye disease to aid these trial are going on in the united state europe canada japan and elsewhere but australia is lagging behind while we remain fairly competitive in fundamental research we are slow to translate our discovery into new therapy this concern wa expressed in the australian academy of science report released today called the stem cell revolution lesson and imperative for australia it contains a series of recommendation from young research leader in the field on how australian science policy can help fasttrack stem cell research here researcher are often asked by patient or their relative when stem cell treatment will be available for certain medical condition ten year ago the answer would have been that there are no new treatment yet but we are working to develop them today we are forced to answer that clinical trial of cell therapy for particular condition are going on but not in australia we have an obligation to ensure that australian patient their family carers and physician are not left behind in the stem cell revolution stem cell therapy human embryonic stem cell which can become cell in any tissue of the body were first discovered in today embryonic stem cell treatment trial are underway for macular degeneration a common form of blindness spinal cord injury juvenile diabetes and heart failure embryonic stem cell therapy are being trialled for macular degeneration a common form of blindness embryonic stem cell therapy are being trialled for macular degeneration a common form of blindness then there are the induced pluripotent stem ip cell that japanese scientist shinya yamanaka discovered which won him the nobel prize in ip cell are made from adult tissue and have many of the defining property of embryonic stem cell they can be made from skin or blood cell of any person after yamanakas discovery japan cell therapy regulatory framework wa modified to fasttrack product from these new stem cell into the clinic a a consequence therapy using induced ip cell which enable close tissue matching of stem cell transplant to patient to prevent graft rejection are now in clinical trial there only ten year after their discovery more trial will begin very soon for instance year of research on midbrain dopaminergic neuron the cell lost in parkinson disease ha paved the way for upcoming trial of stem cell replacing these lost neuron there are also a large number of human trial in progress using mesenchymal stem cell which are extracted from bone marrow fat or other tissue capable of modulating the immune system and inflammatory response these stem cell have the potential ability to treat arthritis autoimmune disorder graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant patient and a number of other condition neural stem cell derived from either foetal or adult brain tissue are also undergoing testing in human for rare inherited disorder of the brain or more common condition including spinal cord injury it unlikely these early stage trial will produce cure for any of these condition indeed they might pose a many question a they answer but it is essential and significant that these trial are moving forward because the lesson we learn from them will guide u towards the design of the next generation of cellular therapeutic gene therapy and drug discovery today genetic modification of stem cell with precision can provide cell therapy that can permanently correct serious genetic disorder human embryonic stem cell can become cell in tissue in any part of the body for year progress in gene therapy wa almost totally blocked by safety concern around the relatively crude technology for introducing genetic alteration into patient cell but technological advance have enabled precise correction of genetic defect within a cell this avoids offtarget modification that can cause cancer and other serious toxicity new treatment using combined gene and cell therapy are undergoing trial now the california institute of regenerative medicinelists about ten new human study including in aid blood disease and cancer then there is a third stream of stem cell research that although perhaps le visible to the general public ha implication well beyond cell therapy this is the ability to derive pluripotent stem cell from patient with genetic predisposition to disease or to introduce disease mutation into stem cell via gene editing we can then use these diseasespecific stem cell line to generate the cell type affected in a particular disorder to study what go wrong with them in the lab for instance we can study how a gene that cause epilepsy affect the electrical property of human nerve cell once we develop these cell culture model we can use them to screen candidate drug to correct the deficit in the affected cell this technology will enable u to reduce dependence on animal model which dont always replicate human disease and will reduce the risk of testing drug on living human subject these advance have the potential to speed the discovery of new medicine to rapidly eliminate candidate drug that might cause toxicity in the clinic and to save million from the cost of drug development to ensure australian patient have timely access to new stem cell therapy for intractable disease we must maintain our excellence in fundamental stem cell research but we also need to develop new and better mechanism to support collaboration between academia the private sector and philanthropist with the aim of translating discovery into cure http theconversationcom stemcelltherapiesareadvancingbutwillaustralianpatientsbeleftbehind mar http margiesjournalblogspotcom stemcelltherapiesareadvancingbuthtml,0

the idea is that vasodilation caused by moderate consumption of alcohol can have heart friendly effect usually in heart failure you try to increase bloodflow to the heart by dilating the coronary artery this is where the idea that some alcohol consumption may have cardioprotective effect i dont know if it proven but i think the european cardiology guideline are on board for this the other extreme is that too much alcohol is bad for the heart too red wine also ha some sort of protein whose name escape me now maybe sirtuins that could slow down cell replication and protect against cancer it all speculative though and every now and again we get contradictory research on this subject mar http wwwredditcom r canada comment bhfao drinkingalcoholoffersnonethealthbenefits limitdn,0

reposted from dr mercola http articlesmercolacom site article archive saltintakeheartfailureaspxxcidnonleadsaltintakeheartfailurefacebookdoc by dr mercola close to million american have heart failure while more than case are diagnosed each year if you have heart failure it mean your heart isnt pumping a well a it should be and a a result your body is probably not getting enough oxygen in other word you have a weak heart oncesimple activity like walking or carrying grocery may become difficult and you may also experience fatigue shortness of breath fluid buildup and coughing because heart failure is associated with fluid buildup a lowsalt diet is typically recommended excess sodium may cause your body to retain water and so the conventional thinking go may worsen the fluid buildup associated with heart failure this dietary dogma is touted a fact but in reality you may want to think twice about slashing your salt intake if you have heart failure a new research ha linked it with an increased risk of death cutting down salt intake might worsen health of heart failure patient researcher from rush university medical center in chicago followed more than heart failure patient for an average of three year both their health status and salt intake were analyzed it turned out that those following a lowsodium diet were percent more likely to die or require hospitalization for heart disease compared to those who didnt restrict their salt intake among those restricting their sodium intake percent died or were hospitalized for heart problem during the study compared to percent of those with no salt restriction the researcher concluded in symptomatic patient with chronic hf heart failure sodium restriction may have a detrimental impact on outcome it possible that restricting salt could backfire by altering a person fluid volume lead researcher dr ramus doukky told medical xpress the idea is sodium restriction lead to a contraction of the fluid volume in the body and that turn on certain hormone which try to retain fluid in the body and may potentially accelerate the heart failure process heart benefit of salt restriction increasingly questioned the heart benefit of restricting salt intake have been questioned for some time in a systematic review of data involving people also found evidence wa lacking to recommend salt restriction among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure salt restriction wa not significantly associated with overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality among those with congestive heart failure meanwhile salt restriction wa associated with increased mortality risk an update to the review published in also found there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effect of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure yet another metaanalysis found that people with heart failure who limited their sodium intake had a percent higher risk of death than those who did not some study have shown a modest benefit to salt restriction among some people with high blood pressure but the evidence doe not extend to the rest of the population so whats really going on for starter there a huge difference between natural salt and the processed salt added to processed food and salt shaker in most home and restaurant the former is essential for good health whereas the latter is best avoided altogether sally fallon morell president of the weston a price foundation stated a study from indicates that people need about one and onehalf teaspoon of salt per day anything le trigger a cascade of hormone to recuperate sodium from the waste stream hormone that make people vulnerable to heart disease and kidney problem this is proven biochemistry too little salt may be dangerous the u food and drug administration fda and the food safety inspection service fsis recommend limiting your daily sodium intake to le than milligram mg they advise a further reduction to mg just over onehalf teaspoon for people who are age and older africanamerican or who have hypertension diabetes or chronic kidney disease this encompasses about half of the u population however there are very real risk from eating too little salt and populationwide recommendation to restrict salt intake to very low level could in fact increase rate of a wide range of disease for instance in one study a lowsalt diet led to an increase in insulin resistance which is a risk factor for type diabetes and the change occurred in just seven day research published in jama also found that consuming le than mg of sodium per day may increase your risk of dying from heart disease a lowsodium diet is even linked to increase in ldl cholesterol and triglyceride and an increased risk of death for diabetic another population thats often advised to restrict their sodium intake there also hyponatremia in which your body ha too little sodium causing fluid level to rise and your cell to swell hyponatremia is most common in older adult and athlete whose sodium level may become depleted by excessive sweating and drinking too much water this swelling can cause a number of health problem from mild to severe at it worst hyponatremia can be life threatening leading to brain swelling coma and death but mild to moderate hyponatremia ha more subtle effect that you or your health care provider may not even connect with a sodiumdeficiency problem including nausea vomiting and change in appetite headache confusion hallucination loss of energy fatigue urinary incontinence nervousness restlessness and irritability and other mood change muscle weakness spasm or cramp seizure unconsciousness coma your sodiumpotassium ratio another factor that can have a significant impact on whether salt will harm or help your health is the ratio between the salt and potassium in your diet your body need potassium to maintain proper ph level in your body fluid and it also play an integral role in regulating your blood pressure it possible that potassium deficiency may be more responsible for hypertension which is a risk factor for heart disease than excess sodium imbalance in your sodiumpotassium ratio can lead to hypertension and the easiest way to achieve this imbalance is by consuming a diet of processed food which are notoriously low in potassium while high in sodium processed food are also loaded with fructose which is clearly associated with increased hypertension risk a well a virtually all chronic disease this may also explain why highsodium diet appear to affect some people but not others according to a federal study into sodium and potassium intake those at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease were those who got a combination of too much sodium along with too little potassium according to dr elena kuklina one of the lead author of the study potassium may neutralize the heartdamaging effect of salt tellingly those who ate a lot of salt and very little potassium were more than twice a likely to die from a heart attack a those who ate about equal amount of both nutrient while potassium is found in many food commonly consumed in the u including fruit vegetable dairy product salmon sardine and nut only percent of u adult get the recommended daily amount of mg the easiest way to achieve an imbalance in your sodiumtopotassium ratio is by consuming a diet of processed food which are notoriously low in potassium while high in processed salt according to the fda percent of american sodium intake come from processed and restaurant food when you reduce processed food in your diet youll automatically reduce your intake of processed salt a well how to improve your sodiumpotassium ratio if you eat a lot of processed food and not many vegetable there a good chance your sodiumtopotassium ratio is unbalanced if youre not sure try a free app like my fitness pal which allows you to enter the food you eat and then calculates the ratio automatically it generally recommended that you consume five time more potassium than sodium but most american get two time more sodium than potassium if your ratio is out of balance ditch all processed food which are very high in processed salt and low in potassium and other essential nutrient eat a diet of whole unprocessed food ideally organically and locally grown to ensure optimal nutrient content this type of diet will naturally provide much larger amount of potassium in relation to sodium when using added salt use a natural salt i believe himalayan salt may be ideal a it contains lower sodium and higher potassium level compared to other saltsit can be difficult to get enough potassium from diet but the best way to do so is to increase the amount of vegetable you consume green vegetable juicing is an excellent way to ensure youre getting enough nutrient for optimal health including about to mg of potassium per cup some additional rich source of potassium are lima bean mg cup winter squash mg cup cooked spinach mg cup avocado mg per medium other potassiumrich fruit and vegetable include fruit papaya prune cantaloupe and banana but be careful of banana a they are high in sugar and have half the potassium of an equivalent amount of green vegetable it is a myth that you are getting load of potassium from banana the potassium is twice a high in green vegetable vegetable broccoli brussels sprout avocado asparagus pumpkin swiss chard and beet green top tip to prevent heart failure and other heart problem there are many strategy that can protect your heart no matter what your age please dont wait until you experience heart attack symptom or heart failure to take action because by then it may be too late do so now in order to prevent any longlasting damage eat unprocessed saturated animal fat and ignore the medium a you will benefit from these fat many may also benefit from increasing the healthy fat in their diet to to percent of daily calorie avoid sugar including processed fructose and grain if you are insulin and leptin resistant it doesnt matter if they are conventional or organic a a highsugar highgrain diet promotes insulin and leptin resistance which is a primary driver of heart disease minimize your intake of salt from processed food and instead use natural himalayan salt to flavor your real food exercise regularly people who engage in at least minute of moderate exercise or minute of vigorous exercise a week had a percent lower risk of heart failure than inactive people use a combination of highintensity interval training strength training stretching and core work avoid excess sitting aim for three hour a day or le of sitting and try to take step a day in addition to your exercise

thanks for your question on healthcare magic i can understand your concern only troponin level are not confirmatory of heart disease sometimes troponin level can be normal and patient is still having heart disease her symptom like chest pain shortness of breath etc are commonly seen with heart failure and coronary heart disease cad so better to consult cardiologist and get done ecg d echo stress test trade mill test all these are needed to confirm heart disease if all these are normal then no need to worry for heart disease sometimes lung infection bronchitis can also cause similar symptom so also get done chest x ray and pft pulmonary function test so first diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment hope i have solved your query i will be happy to help you further wishing good health to your mother in law thanks jun http wwwhealthcaremagiccom question ischestpainandshortbreathasymptomofheartattack answer,0

newswise april depression is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease but a a person depression improves or grows worse their risk for heart disease ha remained largely unknown but now a new study by researcher at the intermountain medical center heart institute in salt lake city found that effectively treating depression can reduce a patient chance of having a stroke heart failure a heart attack or death in fact effective treatment for depression can reduce a patient heart risk to the same level a those who never had shortterm depression the study found our study show that prompt effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health said heidi may phd a cardiovascular epidemiologist with the intermountain medical center heart institute with the help of past research we know depression affect longterm cardiovascular risk but knowing that alleviating the symptom of depression reduces a person risk of heart disease in the short term too can help care provider and patient commit more fully to treating the symptom of depression she said the key conclusion of our study is if depression isnt treated the risk of cardiovascular complication increase significantly dr may presented her finding at the american college of cardiology scientific session in chicago on april researcher havent completely understood whether a shortterm encounter with depression affect a person cardiovascular risk forever or how change in the symptom of depression over time affect cardiovascular risk dr may and her team found answer to these question by studying data compiled in intermountain healthcare depression registry a database of more than patient there little publicallyavailable data about this question dr may said but now with the help of intermountains depression registry we have the ability to start answering some of these difficult question the intermountain medical center heart research team compiled information from patient who completed at least two depression questionnaire over the course of one to two year patient were categorized based on the result of their survey a never depressed no longer depressed remained depressed or became depressed following each patient completion of the last questionnaire patient were followed to see if they had any major cardiovascular problem such a a stroke heart failure heart attack or death at the conclusion of the study percent of patient who were no longer depressed had a similar occurrence of major cardiovascular complication a those who had no depression at all percent those who remained depressed however and those who became depressed throughout the study had increased occurrence of major cardiovascular problem their rate were and percent respectively treatment for depression resulted in a decreased risk of cardiovascular risk that wa similar to someone who didnt have depression a for the practical application of this study dr may said the research indicates that effective treatment for depression decrease the risk of having cardiovascular problem in the short term but further study is needed to identify exactly what that treatment should include what weve done thus far is simply observe data that ha previously been collected dr may said in order to dig deeper we need do a full clinical trial to fully evaluate what weve observed because of the complex nature of depression it hard to say whether depression lead to risk factor associated with cardiovascular problem such a high blood pressure high cholesterol level diabetes or a lack of exercise or if it the other way around result from the study indicate that change in depression symptom may also cause immediate physiological change in the body which in turn cause major cardiovascular problem to occur in the short term but future study are needed to further answer these question other researcher involved in the study include kimberly brunisholz phd benjamin horne phd brent j muhlestein md tami bair rn donald lapp md adam b wilcox phd and brenda reissbrennan phd aprn intermountain medical center is the flagship facility for the intermountain healthcare system which is based in salt lake city apr http todaysseniorsnetworkseniorhealthblogspotcom improvingsymptomsofdepressioncanhtml,0
