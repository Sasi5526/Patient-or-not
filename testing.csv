shannon i use oxygen and actually appreciate it i often wonder what they did in the past when it wa no available i went six month without it and then broke down and eventually had heart failure i appreciate it now that i am using it this is why they say it is a medication i went six month without it and had no idea what wa exactly wrong with my health and had not idea it wa oxygen related due to lung condition but after six month of having very low oxygen and now regaining the oxygen thanks to concentrated oxygen there is such a difference and i appreciate love it i hate that we have to wear the silly cannula and tube and carry a tank around when we either are in bounded or out bounded but i do believe it when they say that we live longer if we use it i do it mainly for myself and my family your family should be proud that you are using it since it is helping your health and causing you to live longer i am sure they areit doe seem it may be yourself being self conscious that is very uncomfortable but in my opinion if someone doesnt like looking at someone who ha a lung handicap then they have the problem not myself and no i will not allow other people to dominate my go abouts either if they dont like it then get use to it is what i would say to them i do get a kick out of small child calling me monster or other name but i just smile at them it is the older one who have the problem and i personally dont care to know thembut honestly i never seem to have the problem with other adultsinstead they smile at me and help me if i need it i knew when i first wore oxygen that it is either be a prisoner at home or go out and be glad that i am alive and enjoy life in bound and out of bound home also my child and husband will have it no other way we dont have other family in my location just son and husband but i do it for them because we have soooo much fun together i just cant let others make me stay indoors like a prisoner and i hope you make that decision too and once you make that decision stick to it i am not ashamed of wearing oxygen since it saved my life too xo feb http wwwpatientcouk forum discus iamnewbutwouldliketoknowhowmanyfolksareonoorderlatest

week day making it to friday seemed like it would never come part of me wa impatient and the other part of me hoped it really wouldnt come the reality is friday did come i went into the fertility office that day doing anything and everything i could to not focus on what wa going to happen a they called my name i took a deep breath and hoped for the best the nurse debbie took me back she had been through this with u for the last month but we knew the risk this time were higher a she did the typical check in i said to her we are hoping for good news i prayed for the first time in year she became tearful hugged me and reminded me that everyone wa praying and hoping for good news when the dr came in to start the ultra sound it wa almost a if we were pretending thing were not that bad katie who had came in place of mike due to work obligation stood next to me she asked do you need me to hold you or something to that affect and i remember saying no a my whole world started to spin a the dr looked around i focused on finding the heart beat i had done this and experienced this enough that i knew if it wa there i would see it panic started to sink in it wasnt there i looked at the screen and away at the wall a million time in full panic the room wa so quiet which increased my worry more i had to ask do you see the heart beat i swear i asked time before the response registered he told me there another bloodclot by the placenta and it look like it pulling down and away why dont you sit up and we will talk what doe that mean i felt like he wa walking around giving me answer he continued to tell me that the heart beat wa not there the placenta wa pulling away because the pregnancy wa over the baby stopped growing at week day and it appears there wa something structural wrong i asked about the congestive heart failure he said it appeared that this wa why the heart isnt beating i sat there trying not to cry holding it together a well a i could looking away from him because the eye contact would only make it worse three option were given to me one wait to miscarry on my own two take medication to force the miscarriage into place or three have a dc i originally said i didnt know what i wanted to do the truth is i wa half between screaming youre lying and the other half wanting to scream get the baby out nowits cowardly i know but i wa loosing it and hanging on by this little piece of hope that didnt really exist the dr said i didnt have to decide right then and i could call a i left debbie stopped me she hugged me and took me into their lab room she gathered tissue while the other nurse april hugged me and sat me down she handed me a kit for genetic testing you take the sample if you miscarry at home who even knew such a thing existed debbie asked if i wa doing the medication i told her i didnt know what to do she told me it caused pain and it wa hurtful which quickly helped me make up my mind i decided to go home and wait if it didnt happen on it own i would have the dc tuesday waiting is the hardest part i have been carrying around this kit for a little over day every bathroom visit is plagued with fear and the thought of am i strong enough to do this kit at home lay firmly on my mind i keep going through the emotion they come in wave i cry i find happiness in simple thing i cry tear of joy when my little addy comfort me or play dr and reminds me that your heart is hurt it funny the thing kid know but the hurt my heart is feeling is terrible my heart is hurting for me and my husband and our family and i feel the weight of the world and still we must wait last night i laid in the bathtub submerged in the water i had my head down a far a it could go the water to edge of my outer eye i laid there numb a the tear flowed they streamed right into the water the relief of them not sliding down my face wa somehow relaxing i relived the last three week i relived the fear the heart ache and the excitement that all come with pregnancy and i grieved or started to we dont know all that is coming and we dont have to but what i do know is that we have each other and we are lucky for that we have one happy and healthy little girl and nothing can replace that our fertility journey may not be over and this may just be a bump in the road but right now it our life and we are just trying to survive it i wavered back and forth on wether or not to share this post partially because it personal and in part because it a sad reality no one want to hear but over these year we have met supported and been supported by so many on our first fertility journey and through this one i felt it wa only fair to be honest that not every story end with a baby although we wish it would we are currently week day and still waiting to miscarry a i am reminded each time we leave the house and i have to grab the kit the reality is our baby is gone and a much a i wish that little heart would start beating again it not going to sometimes i fear that mine will stop too but the truth is it wont and i a well a my family will keep going jul http myhostileuterusblogspotcom waitingishardestparthtml

raryn said sir is a concept with excellent sensitivity to get you to consider systemic infection and obviously no specificity spring down the hall and you will probably meet sir but you obviously dont have a focus for infection and will be back to normal pretty quickly there some question of there being septic patient who dont meet sir but that all depends on whose definition of sepsis you use and for a quick initial screen it isnt bad otoh the new q sofa score in the sepsis guideline that came out in february seems useless the only thing in the qsofa are rr hotn and am and if you need a scoring system to tell you to investigate am or hotn you should probably go back to medical school or become a pathologist the full sofa is even worse going from reasonably easy parameter to remember sir to parameter each with different number to keep in mind because of how point are tallied up it practically impossible to calculate without an app website and doesnt really affect management at all an elevated sofa just tell you that the patient ha organ dysfunction which you can see from the organ dysfunction you had to identify to calculate the sofa edit small point for clarity sofa and qsofa are largely worthless in the ed and derived from a large pool of icu patient alot of these study lack generalization to the ed take the france central line trial for example site taken a is i appreciate the sentiment and the drive to identify this stuff early but then you get the upcoming recommendation from the rd surviving sepsis campaign and it then taken a gospel adopted by cm and now we are held to an unreasonable standard cc kg bolus chf be damned for example no real point to this just illustrates the carousel we are all on jun http forumsstudentdoctornet thread cmpcbcanduaforsprainedankledefensivemedicine post

always happens to me too even if i do a small shot it bad for your heart to race that fast because st it a muscle so it kind of like it doing thousand of push ups which cause it to get larger cardiomyopathy which is not a good thing it can lead to sudden death and congestive heart failure also when your heart beat that fast it not get sufficient blood to many area of the body including your heart which cause cardiac ischemia damage to heart due to lack of oxygen and a heart attack total death of heart tissue you may have a heart attack and not know it i swear ive had two please dont do what i did but i didnt go to the hospital because i wa afraid on how i would be treated being a nurse myself i know how some nurse and doctor treat people like that however when i odd on heroin the nurse couldnt have been sweeter but i wasnt an asshole either and wa polite a possible in the end whether or not how they treat you theyll save your damn life it also can cause heart arrhythmia like frequent pvc which can be benign harmless or they could lead to more dangerous thing it can cause afiberation where the atrium of the heart doesnt contract properly but kind of quiver causing blood stasis in the atrium and when blood just sits around and doesnt move it clot it will eventually be ejected and if there is a clot it can be thrown into your lung or brain causing a pulmonary emoblism or stroke and it can also cause vfib where the ventricular valve quiver and doesnt contract thats the most deadly if youre not ejecting blood then you will die when someone go into vfib they those conciousness pretty fast and in the hospital even if their heart still ha electrical activity like it doe in vfib it consider a code thats when well do compression and shock and unlike the movie if your heart is completely flatlined no electrical activity you cannot shock the person because it is useless it wont convert the deadly heart rhythm back into normal sinus anyways not trying to scare sometimes i wish i didnt go to college and study biology and nursing and never worked in critical care i think i make myself freak out too much because of the thing ive learned and seen just be very careful with shooting up small do if you have to and not doing it multiple hour in a day saturating your body with meth same go with smoking and everything other roa i still use so im not coming on here to convince people to quit but everyone in my opinion need to be informed and a heart rate over is deadly and you should immediately go the er or call an ambulance and not worry about what anyone think it better that someone save your life and think of you a a meth head than to die may http drugsforumcom forum showthreadphptpost

i am going to share something i have shared with very few people and something that ha never been put into writing despite many attempt only my wife parent and grandparent know of this the primary reason being that it wa such a horrible thing to have happened to a year old boy that even thinking about it slightly would trigger a full blown paralyzing panic attack for over year it is the single most traumatic event in my life i am sharing this a a form of self therapy i speak from personal experience that the way strong trauma affect people can have long lasting and completely unexpected effect i wa born with a terminal heart and lung condition i wa the third person ever able to be treated for it and the first to ever survive i have had five open heart surgery and more other invasive test procedure done than i could ever even try to count and while part of the truama is that i have woken up during a couple of those surgery the event that i am going to share with you eclipse even that horror by several magnitude the point is i wa in the hospital a lot a a child and not for small routine thing by the time i wa or i pretty much had the floor plan of the hospital memorized i knew where i wa and how to get anywhere else on any of the or so floor of the building i wa going in for another lifesaving operation when i wa year old is when it happened the nurse gave me some medication to relax in my hospital room and put me in a gurney this wa normal for my life and i wa comfortable and happy a you could be in that situation all while i wa slowly losing motor control then we went down a long corridor to some part of the hospital i had never seen before many year later i learned that we actually crossed a bridge to the next door building which wa the other half of the hospital complex but i did not know that at this time i wa suddenly thrust into the unknown in a rapidly increasing helpless state a we travel down strange corridor filled with hospital staff i actually did not know my anxiety continued to grow by the time we reached our destination i wa completely incapable of movement or speech but still completely conscious and clear thinking all of my sen were working at but there wa no way to signal my distress we were in a high end s operating room that wa painted dark blue to this day i get apprehensive at the sight of that color and flee from any room that mimic it a soon a is reasonably possible i have termed the entire experience the blue room a a way to talk about it if you need a visual aid it looked very much like this but i am unable to search for a higher quality representative for reason that should be obvious http blogmediligencecom wpcontent uploads operatingroomjpg once in the operating room i wa transferred to the operating table and left there while the doctor and staff prepared for what they were going to do to me right in front of me in plain sight i laid there surrounded by terrifying machine whose function i could not comprehend a they got out and filled a tray directly in front of me with scalpel forceps bone saw needle tubing and anything else they required i could see and hear everything clearly including how they were discussing the very low probability that i would even survive this operation at this point i am screaming and cry a loud a i can in my head i dont want to do this i dont want to do this this isnt right i dont want to do this no sound or movement wa possible or noticeable to those around me i had been rendered silent by the relaxing drink after what i am certain wa several minute of this i lost my vision everything went black but i wa still conscious for at least another couple of minute my last thought wa me cry i dont want to do this and then i died i am not saying that for dramatic effect that wa the only way my therapist year later could help me come to term with it it took u over a dozen hour long session just for me to even get to the point that i could think about the entire incident without being a cry mess for often several hour obviously i survived and even thrived to a certain degree a i am now year old but this wa such a bad time that i actually blocked it from my memory for those year until after the second incident the blue room event wa directly related to another similar incident nearly year later when i wa i wa again going to have another operation and this time it wa in a similar operating room but this time it wa painted brown i call this one the brown room to differentiate the place and event enough to be able to discus it keep in mind by year old i wa literally an emaciated pound weakling in heart failure who could not walk up several flight of stair without resting i wa placed on the metal operating table only this time i had not been rendered helpless by being given something to relax my mother wa also in the operating room this time a well before the staff prepared like i said they knew u and she wa an rn anyway i wa perfectly fine for at least a few minute when i suddenly started to feel fear i did not know what wa happening or why i felt this way but it continued to grow in strength quickly with no external source i could discern my mother first noticed and tried to calm me but her word had no effect then an orderly came in and decided to try and restrain me that wa a mistake i exploded all these year later i still remember having one crystal clear realization at that moment i am not helpless this time i can fight at the time i did not even understand what this time meant but i fought and i fought viciously my sole consuming desire wa to get out of that room and kill anything that got in my way including my own mother i am certain that i caused at least some minor injury to the orderly and his friend who helped him restrain me until they were able to get me sedated all of them were bigger men than i am today after that operation i remembered the first incident but the two event were linked in my mind in some way i could not understand i could not think of one without thinking of the other and the terror just fed on itself until it burned itself out anything could trigger it but seeing that dark blue color or certain part of a hospital always did i could be having panic attack that lasted hour because of this it ha effected me today i cannot be bound or rendered incapable of movement and i cannot be awake when i enter an operating room if such thing happen then i immediately go into the kind of reaction a in the brown room the only thing i will be concerned with is getting free and i will kill anything or anyone in my way regardless of who they are it is automatic i cannot control it until i get free of the situation and can calm down the good news is that in a way the brown room wa an empowering event i learned that if something bad ever happened or if i wa ever attacked i could actually stand my ground and if not win at least give a good a i got regardless of being disabled or not jesus christ that wa a bitch to write im going to go cuddle up with my kitty and comfort food may http wwwredditcom r askreddit comment ieb

one reason why addressing disparity is one of pcoris five national priority for research which govern how pcori award it research dollar the addressing disparity program now includes a substantial portfolio of study designed to determine how to reduce barrier to effective preventive diagnostic or therapeutic care taking into account individual and group preference to achieve the best outcome in each population seeking new approach both the cm office of minority health and pcori also are concerned with strengthening the healthcare workforce to better serve vulnerable and underserved patient population this includes initiative focusing on how to better make use of lay member of healthcare teamswho are known for example a community health worker patient navigator and promotores de saludas link between patient community and the healthcare system cm office of minority health is working on how to support engage and empower these professional while pcori ha funded more than project that are comparing health outcome and other aspect of program that do and dont include lay member of healthcare team one large study involving primary care clinic and almost patient compare the effectiveness of a clinicbased standard of care to a collaborative approach that includes community health worker it asks whether the collaborative approach improves hypertension control for racial and ethnic minority and other group that experience disparity in this condition delivering health information and service via telecommunication telehealth is another area that both cm and pcori are exploring a a mean to reduce disparity pcori is currently funding project on telehealth many of which focus on underserved population one of these study compare the effectiveness of a telehealth selfmanagement approach versus traditional inperson care for africanamerican and hispanic latino patient with chronic heart failure in the telehealth intervention a care provider contact the patient weekly via a video call the study will measure emergency room use quality of life and other outcome another cm initiative is looking for way to expand the use of telehealth in rural area where health care tends to be le available than elsewhere reducing disparity in chronic disease treatment and outcome both the cm office of minority health and pcori have a commitment to reducing disparity in the treatment of a range of illness among these is asthma which is more prevalent and severe among african american and hispanic latino than among white a are a range of disparity in health outcome at pcori there are more than a dozen project addressing racial and ethnic disparity in asthma treatment outcome these include eight study that compare way to increase patient and clinician adherence to the national asthma education and prevention program guideline project team include patient clinician insurer health system community clinic and practice public health department and patient and caregiver advocacy organization accelerating health equity the cm office of minority health and pcori are just two of many organization working to move our nation further along the path to health equity however to achieve that goal we need more individual organization and community to join the effort we look forward to working with you to make health equity a realitythis placeholder text apr

latvia crocodile harry inspiration for hollywood adelaide australia this vast antipodean island is famous for it unforgiving and beautiful outback kangaroo populate the plain koala hang in the tree and kookaburra flutter through the sky above while venomous snake often slither quietly through the reed ready to strike at a moment notice it is in australia long and winding river where you really have to watch out a lurking beneath the surface could be the smiling face of a deadly crocodile the danger of crocodile are well known here so well known that in earlier time crocodile hunter would often become celebrity renowned throughout australia for their courage and skill the most famous of them all wa crocodile harry and curiously he wa a latvian who hailed from the village of dundaga in the region of kurzeme kilometer from riga a distance many australian would describe a close to latvia capital known primarily for it th century medieval castle the village of dundaga commemorates crocodile harry whose latvian name is arvids blumentals with a massive twoton concrete sculpture of one the largest of all living reptile and terrestrial predator in the world the most dangerous extant crocodilian to human a saltwater crocodile it remains an enigma to many baffled visitor of the town visitor who may be unaware of the dundagas infamous son who wa born there in but emigrated to australia in depicted with wide glaring eye with sharp long teeth housed in a long snouted muzzle and in a crouching attack position this sculpture represents a formidable and opportunistic hyper carnivorous ambush predator it is in memory of all of dundagas strong men and the strongest wa blumentals so read the plaque attached to the sculpture blumentals wa known to a chameleon character adapting quickly to his new environment and the difference between the two environment could hardly be more pronounced moving from latvia boreal forest to australia dusty outback could not have been easy and culturally the change required for blumental must have been enormous setting off to australia wa a path taken by many latvian in the year after world war two but hunting crocodile in the outback mean that all too often youre on your own even his name provided difficulty arvids wa a hard name for australian to pronounce so he changed it to harry crocs blumenthals larger than life adventurous story may seem like a good piece of bush folklore particularly to australian but whether real or just perhaps made up his exploit have appeared in newspaper article and magazine across the world numerous documentary film they say a many a and countless tv feature have been made about blumenthals colourful life crocodile harry allegedly killed a whopping crocodile over a year period while in australia blumenthal also caught smaller crocodile which were up to two metre in length with only his bare hand hollywood star it ha been noted that blumenthal may have been the prototype to the hollywood comedy film crocodile dundee but this get you into controversial water a it ha been widely disputed the film wa set in the australian outback and starred the australian actor paul hogan in the lead role of the weathered mick dundee a crocodile hunter crocodile hunting wa banned in australia in which saw blumentals settling in opal town of coober pedy in the state of south australia a town considered the opal mining capital of the world in coober pedy an anglicised version of the aboriginal word kupa piti meaning white man in a hole the former latvian crocodile hunter tried his hand at opal mining and wa to rapidly achieve legendary status with his exploit it wa in coober pedy that he excavated his extravagant and bizarre underground dugout a home typical of coober pedy which wa to become one of the town most prominent and popular tourist attraction it wa proposed for heritage listing in known a the crocodile nest blumenthals dugout constructed in an underground cave carved out of a hillside is situated kilometre from the town centre near the four mile opal field blumentals directed all his creative energy into his dugout which featured tribal graffiti covered wall festooned with woman under garment and signature of over virgin scrawled on the wall by female visitor who stayed in his dugout it is also adorned with weird sculpture created by blumentals own hand his clutter filled residence wa featured in the australian postapocalyptic action adventure film mad max beyond thunderdome which starred mel gibson and tina turner near the entrance of the dugout the film crew upon concluding filming erected a sculpture which they named the orchestra when the wind blow the sculpture reverberates in the stillness of the desert in a performance of eclectic sound the death certificate record von blumentals arvids croc harry death on oct he wa to later declare himself a latvian baron forced to leave latvia at the conclusion of the second world

about the heart ability to repair itself i have often wondered about a diseased heart ability to repair itself because i have experienced this on a couple of occasion i am a year autistic socially avoidant male who ha made poor life decision and is currently facing heart failure but the heart can recover from period of extreme stress when palpitation and fatigue knock you down prolonged rest doe the trick or did for me twice i cured a fast irregular heartbeat that almost brought me to my knee with prolonged rest but a chd progress to heart failure the heart can no longer repair itself just curious a to what the repair mechanism are at work here doe the coronary artery cleanse itself or somehow close off problem area reroute blood rebuild the muscle now that is shouldering the burden of pumping now what did my heart do to eliminate my irregular heart beat on two occasion the term heart failure implies that such repair is longer possible again what exactly is going on internally i suppose i can just google up more info but im curious about how it is determined that indeed your heart is now failing a opposed to being diseased and exactly what change have occurred in the heart what can the heart self repair how doe it do it and what can it not repair thanks aldri jul http wwwmedhelporg post show

article distributed under the creative common attribution license which permit unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited according to current european classification cardiomyopathy are defined a myocardial disorder that cannot be explained by coronary artery disease or abnormal loading condition including valvular and congenital disease six specific morphological and functional phenotype are distinguished hypertrophic dilated restrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy together with two unclassified subtypes takotsubo and left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy in almost all of these phenotype inherited form may be found moreover in some of themfor example in hypertrophic cardiomyopathya genetic origin is even a rule therefore genetic counseling shall be an integral part of the stateoftheart care of patient with heart muscle disorder the affected individual together with their relative have to be informed about the genetic basis of their disease and the potential risk for other family member a detailed cardiac evaluation including ecg and echocardiography in some case also holter ecg monitoring of firstdegree relative is necessary with their further regular followup if available genetic testing shall be discussed with the patient a it may improve their management a well a enable effective preventive genetic testing in other relative because the evaluation of morphology and function of the heart especially of the left ventricle is a prerequisite for accurate phenotypic characterization of every myocardial disease a multimodality imaging approach generally becomes necessary echocardiography is still a cornerstone of diagnostic imaging because it is accurate widely available safe and without any contraindication in recent year advanced echo modality gained a clinical role in the followup of chemotherapyinduced cardiomyopathy and global longitudinal strain is recommended in the latest european guideline however the role of cardiac magnetic resonance is increasingly important not only is it the current gold standard for morphological and functional assessment of heart chamber but it ha a unique opportunity of noninvasive tissue characterization based on evaluation of the presence of myocardial edema hyperemia and necrosis using dedicated sequence cardiac magnetic resonance is capable of diagnosing acute myocarditis with high accuracy late gadolinium enhancement technique is widely used to as the presence and extent of replacement myocardial fibrosis which appears to be strongly related to the prognosis of affected individual presence of myocardial fibrosis predisposes to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia sudden cardiac death and progression of left ventricular dysfunction associated with heart failure worsening one also ha to mention the significant contribution of various technique of nuclear medicine for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy it is obvious that increasing knowledge on ethiopathogenesis of various myocardial disorder together with improved diagnostic possibility shall result in novel therapeutic option a complex immunohistochemical and pcr analysis of endomyocardial biopsy specimen allows u to characterize in more detail the presence and type of myocardial inflammation a well a the presence of possible causative infectious agent and select better more targeted treatment of acute myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy with administration of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug or antiviral agent many therapeutic strategy are currently investigated in the field of transthyretin amyloidosis including stabilizer of transthyretin tetramers and gene therapy aimed at suppression of transthyretin expression another important topic is the development of new treatment possibility that will be able to prevent late sequela of cytostatic therapy associated with potential cardiotoxic effect in this special issue we are pleased to introduce several interesting original a well a review article focused on different topic in the field of myocardial disease i two original article deal with the topic of chemotherapyinduced cardiotoxicity p robinson et al investigated in their experimental study the role of substance p in chemotherapyassociated death of cardiomyocytes and chemoresistance and nicely showed that aprepitant a substance p receptor antagonist is able to decrease doxorubicin induced death of cardiomyocytes a well a to increase the sensitivity of cancer cell to this drug a f yu et al evaluated the use of d speckle tracking echocardiography in early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and radiation therapy their result confirm that this novel imaging modality is more sensitive in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction than traditional index of ventricular function such a ejection fraction and thus can be used for longterm cardiac surveillance of adult cancer survivor ii three article review several aspect of inflammation infection related myocardial disease j krejci et al largely summarize our current knowledge on pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy with emphasis on accurate evaluation of endomyocardial biopsy sample which is prerequisite for the appropriate choice of subsequent treatment option p kuchynka et al nicely overview a difficult topic of eosinophilic myocarditis a rare disorder necessitating quite rapid diagnosis so early administration of immunosuppressive therapy that may improve the poor prognosis of affected individual can be initiated in the last article r h lumsden and g s bloomfield present a brilliant review on hivassociated cardiomyopathy which currently represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this now chronic disease the author clearly demonstrate that there is a significant need to design clear guideline for screening protocol and diagnostic criterion for hivrelated myocardial disease iii several issue related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are discussed in three article r pudil et al aimed to investigate the significance of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and their result show that increased level of this substance are associated with structural and functional parameter in patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggesting the possibility of it use for a more accurate diagnosis l k williams et al focused on left atrial function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using magnetic resonance velocity vector imaging they convincingly demonstrate a negative impact of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction on left atrial size and function that significantly improves after septal myectomy finally p p dimitrow and r rajtarsalwa review several aspect related to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with emphasis on invasive a well a noninvasive treatment possibility if the reader will find the presented article informative and stimulating their interest in

it a familiar feeling for any caffeine addict a racing heart fluttering away after one too many espresso shot for year thats been enough to steer people with certain heart condition away from coffee but a it turn out there little evidence that a caffeine habit could send u into cardiac arrest thats according to dr greg marcus a professor at the university of californiasan francisco and this week guest on the inquiring mind podcast marcus specializes in the treatment of arrhythmia or irregular heartbeatsthe fast sluggish or offkilter rhythm that can trigger sudden cardiac arrest an unexpected loss of heart function the condition is different from a heart attack which is caused by blockage to blood vessel leading to the heart and it ha seen comparatively little progress in treatment and prevention marcus say in the united state sudden cardiac arrest kill adult each year last year marcus research team looked into the relationship between caffeine and a type of arrhythmia called early beat which can be a risk factor for developing heart failure you can think of this condition a individual heart cell gone rogue if you take a heart cell out of the heart put it in a petri dish and keep it alive it will beat on it own marcus tell cohost kishore hari sometimes those cell will jump the gun beating a little earlier than the rest of the heart there this conventional wisdom that more caffeine lead to these early beat marcus say to find out if thats really the case his the team monitored heart rhythm along with consumption of common caffeine fix such a tea coffee and chocolate what they discovered might surprise you we could find no evidence of a relationship say marcus the result were published in the journal of the american heart association still marcus caution that the heart risk of caffeine may depend on the individual and that more work need to be done to unpack the role of a patient unique genetics and environmental exposure this tie into a broader need for more precision medicine he sayshighly personalized treatment that take those specific factor into account the hope is that with modern technique to sequence gene a well a to potentially monitor activity using technology maybe we can really get down to that level he say cue health eheart a pioneering big data approach to develop strategy to prevent and treat all aspect of heart disease the goal of the project is to use personal technology to free largescale clinical research from it traditional home in brickandmortar hospital where researcher capture a controlled artificial snapshot of participant health and behavior by gathering information from online survey and personal gadget anything from smartphones to bluetoothenabled blood pressure cuff marcus team at ucsf is able to study a continuous stream of health data a participant go about their daily activity thats what i like to call realtime reallife data he say participant are given the option to get involved in a variety of study depending on their background and the device they use owner of a smart watch for example might be asked to opt into an ongoing study on atrial fibrillationan irregular beat in the heart upper chamber thats an important risk factor for stroke the study attempt to develop a more nuanced understanding of what trigger the condition making use of the watch heart rate monitor to interlace rhythmic data with other instantaneous measure of health and physical activity while the health eheart project aim to unpack the individualized factor that carry risk for heart disease marcus also hope it will play a more foundational role for further researchseparating the wheat from the chaff a he put it by helping to figure out whether wearable device are a beneficial to public health research a their maker chalk them up to be fitbit and the apple watch are example he say of device with savvy health and fitness marketing but stilluntested claim is it useful for health we make that assumption but how valid is it and if it is valid what is the best way to use it ucsf hope to enroll million people in health eheart if you want to take part in this ambitious study you can sign up for the special inquiring mind health eheart group anyone over year old is eligible including those who are completely healthy have heart disease or are patient with cardiovascular condition that we dont yet know how to treat participation requires a few hour over the course of the year note inquiring mind cohost kishore hari is an academic staff member of ucsf but he not affiliated in any way with the health

drug dmards to manage your ra condition you and your doctor should discus any potential side effect that can occur during your treatment here are eight ra medication side effect to be aware of nsaid and stomach problem nsaid which block the inflammation of ra can be present in both prescription drug and overthecounter drug like ibuprofen the most common side effect are stomach problem like heartburn and belching but you can minimize these risk by taking the medication with food and just remember once you start ra management nsaid use should be only for addon symptom relief say matthew husa md a rheumatologist and assistant professor in the division of rheumatology and immunology at the ohio state medical center in columbus nsaid and bleeding using nsaid can irritate the lining of your stomach which can then lead to bleeding and unfortunately taking the medication with food might not help if you are frequently taking overthecounter nsaid you need to let your doctor know say dr horowitz your provider might be able to give you a medication that will reduce your risk of bleeding while taking nsaid and in the meantime you can further cut your risk by avoiding alcohol steroid and toxicity steroid in ra management get symptom under control quickly but they may also cause high blood pressure weight gain high blood sugar and decreased bone health thats one reason theyre a better shortterm solution steroid can be used for a while until dmards kick in dr husa say they are guaranteed to be toxic if you use them too long by limiting your exposure your doctor can help protect you from steroid side effect methotrexate fog trexall methotrexate is usually the first dmard used for ra management methotrexate doe more than relieve symptom it also slows down the disease state the john hopkins arthritis center it is given once a week a an injection or can be taken in pill form common side effect include nausea headache fatigue and feeling wiped out almost a if youre in a fog but by taking methotrexate at night you may be able to minimize these problem likewise you can avoid feeling nauseous if you opt for the injection under the skin taking folic acid a b vitamin along with methotrexate may also help limit side effect horowitz say methotrexate liver damage the most serious side effect of methotrexate is liver damage thats why people with existing liver disease arent good candidate for this medication according to the john hopkins arthritis center you should have your liver checked with a blood test when you start methotrexate and about every two month while you are taking it husa say to avoid liver damage while taking the medication limit alcoholic drink to a maximum of one or two per week triple therapy and eye damage combining methotrexate with two other dmards may be an option if methotrexate alone isnt enough to achieve good ra management according to john hopkins one of the drug used in this triple therapy is hydroxychloroquine a malaria drug thats effective for some case of ra for this particular dmard the most serious possible side effect is eye damage although you should have an eye exam by an eye specialist within six month of starting this drug and be rechecked at regular interval recommended by your rheumatologist you should tell your doctor immediately if you start having eye pain sensitivity to light or vision change say horowitz biologic drug and infection biologic drug are the newest addition to ra management your doctor may recommend one of these drug if older dmards are not helping the biggest worry with biologics is an increased risk of infection horowitz say before you begin treatment with biologic drug your doctor is likely to test you for tuberculosis and hepatitis because biologics weaken your immune system and could reactivate those infection and if you have another active infection your doctor may want to wait until you recover once you begin using biologics wash your hand frequently avoid people who are sick and tell your doctor if you develop a cough fever or symptom of a cold biologic drug and other issue there are rare report that biologic drug can possibly increase the risk for some cancer psoriasis multiple sclerosis and heart failure husa say but the research is still inconclusive in any case the benefit of a biologic outweigh these risk husa say your best defense against

translation youre working the overnight shift it am and youre starting to dream of a breakfast sandwich and bed but no it your lucky morning and in roll a yearold man in acute respiratory distress he is hypertensive tachycardic and tachypneic a quick bedside ultrasound reveals bilateral b line that convince you that the patient is in acute pulmonary edema ape or acute decompensated heart failure adhf the lead ecg reveals only sinus tachycardia and your nurse asks you how much furosemide you want to give congestive heart failure is a common problem in the united state with more than five million patient carrying the diagnosis and new diagnosis each year mt sinai j med ape occurs when blood back up into the pulmonary vasculature leading to increased oncotic pressure and leakage of fluid into the alveolar space put more simply these patient are drowning ape patient suffer from increased afterload making it more difficult for the left ventricle to function and increased preload a such the goal of treatment must be directed at decreasing cardiac filling pressure preload and decreasing afterload neurohormonal activation also worsens cardiac performance and increase intravascular volume and vascular tone the mainstay of ape treatment for decade ha been loop diuretic mainly furosemide the central role these drug continue to play highlight a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the disease pathophysiology of ape the cardiorenal model wa first put forward in the s a the predominant explanation for ape it wa believed that decreased blood flow to the kidney led to decreased renal function and fluid retention leading to volume overload this wa the basis for loop diuretic being recommended it wa clear however that this model wa insufficient because it did not explain why the disease progressed or the finding of increased peripheral vasoconstriction from invasive monitoring study the cardiocirculatory model wa first put forth in the s this model argued that peripheral vasoconstriction led to decreased cardiac function and that increased preload and afterload were at the center of the problem this model explained much of what we see occurring in ape finally researcher in the s established the neurohormonal model in which neurohormone norepinephrine renin angiotensin aldosterone are upregulated in ape these compound have vasoactive property leading to vasoconstriction and increase intravascular volume current recommendation for ape treatment are based on the integration of the cardiovascular and the neurohormonal model the myth of volume overload regardless of the pathophysiology patient are still volume overloaded right the best evidence suggests it is not that simple zile et al demonstrated that most patient with ape have increased cardiac filling pressure but most did not have a significant increase from their dry weight on presentation circulation more than percent of patient in fact gain le than two pound circulation if this is not fluid gain where did the increased filling pressure originate it turn out it is largely a result of change in compliance in the splanchnic system that lead to fluid shifting from here to the cardiopulmonary circulation circ heart fail even in the face of this evidence the loop diuretic supporter argue that some patient are overloaded so why not give all of these patient the drug this approach doe not account for the potential downside administration of furosemide activates the neurohormonal system which lead to increased plasma renin and norepinephrine level this result in decreased lv function increased lv filling pressure increased map and svr and decreased gfr ann intern med an icu study from found that furosemide increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the first minute of treatment chest this is particularly worrisome because ape is a deadly disease and what we do in the first to minute of the patient presentation make a huge difference so how should we treat patient with ape noninvasive positive pressure ventilation nippv nippv ha multifactorial action in ape it decrease work of breathing stentsopen alveolus during the entire respiratory cycle leading to improved gas exchange and in the case of bilevel nippv decrease afterload a number of paper have shown decreased intubation rate and decreased icu utilization with the use of nippv the most recent study showed a decreased icu admission from to percent j emerg med a cochrane review also found that nippv reduced hospital mortality rr and endotracheal intubation rr cochrane database syst rev jul cd the key for nippv is to start it immediately on presentation to the ed it will likely help with preoxygenation even if it doe not stave off intubation nitroglycerin many study have looked at the use of nitroglycerin comparing it with furosemide and evaluating at highdose therapy am j cardiol lancet ann emerg med nitroglycerin is recommended for all patient with

the best food source of potassium the recommended daily value of milligram for adult men and woman how to solve an electrolyte imbalance adjust your diet the first step to correcting an electrolyte imbalance is to identify how it developed in the first place for many people a poor diet thats high in processed food containing lot of sodium but low in other electrolyte like magnesium or potassium pave the way for a dangerous imbalance in many case a minor electrolyte imbalance can be corrected by simply making dietary change and cutting way back on junk food takeout and restaurant food while instead cooking more fresh food at home focus your diet around whole unpackaged food especially plenty of vegetable and fruit that provide potassium and magnesium some of the best include leafy green cruciferous veggie like broccoli or cabbage starchy vegetable like sweet potato or squash banana and avocado a diet thats rich in magnesium or potassium likely can be enough to solve problem like low potassium level that can lead to blood pressure problem or magnesium deficiency that can contribute to anxiety restlessness and muscle cramp to prevent dehydration and restore electrolyte focus on these food which are some of the most hydrating due to being very waterdense coconut water celery watermelon cucumber kiwi bell pepper citrus fruit carrot cultured dairy amasai kefir yogurt pineappleanother thing to consider is whether youre consuming enough calcium with or without eating dairy product it possible to get calcium from leafy green other veggie bean and legume to obtain enough calcium naturally without needing supplement consider adding highquality and ideally raw dairy product to your diet if you can tolerate them food like organic probiotic yogurt cultured raw cheese and raw milk provide high level of electrolyte in addition to other important nutrient monitor your sodium intake when you do consume packaged or processed food check the sodium level sodium is an electrolyte that play a significant part in the body ability to retain or release water so if your diet is very high in sodium more water is excreted by the kidney and this can cause complication with balancing other electrolyte here how sodium work within the body essentially water follows salt which mean if you increase sodium too much water retention also occurs at the same time the opposite is also true a loss in sodium result in a loss in water potentially causing dehydration and extreme thirst hypernatremia the name of the condition that develops when either too much water is lost or too much sodium is obtained is more common among older adult people with diabetes and those who eat heavily processed diet people can also lose a high level of sodium through diarrhea taking certain diuretic or laxative and exercising to extreme level and overtraining without staying hydrated all of which cause problem of their own monitoring how much sodium you consume help keep symptom at bay including bloating lethargy dehydration weakness irritability and muscle twitching drinking water and eating mostly whole food not the kind that come in package also ensures you obtain enough other important electrolyte drink enough water but not too much electrolyte imbalance can develop when the amount of water in your body change either causing dehydration not enough water compared to certain elevated electrolyte or overhydration too much water drinking enough water without overdiluting your cell help stop level of sodium and potassium from rising too high or too low how much water is the right amount for you it all depends on your specific need do you exercise often do you live in a warm climate that result in you sweating do you eat a lot of waterrich fruit or vegetable or more processed food while eight glass a day ha always been the standard recommendation this isnt necessarily the best amount for every person since factor like your diet age physical activity level and body size all determine how much water you need a good rule of thumb is to drink enough so you urinate at least every three to four hour which for most people is around eight to eightounce glass daily if you practice vigorous exercise especially in warm hot weather that increase sweat production make sure to replenish with plenty of water and electrolyte like premade formula that include sodium if youve been sick including with a fever that cause vomiting or diarrhea keep in mind that you lose fluid and should increase your intake if not you risk developing dehydration symptom kidney stone bladder infection urinary tract stone and potentially even heart failure thats why it so important to protect yourself from dehydration woman who are pregnant or breastfeeding also need additional fluid about cup every day to stay hydrated and prevented deficiency a do teenager who are growing and developing faster than people of other age is it possible to drink too much water overhydration is rare but yes it possible your kidney are unable to excrete very high level of excess water so this can mean electrolyte within the blood can become diluted the result might be low sodium level which is more common among endurance athlete who often try to compensate for sweating by drinking lot of water but not very likely to develop in someone eating the standard american diet thats high in salt white bean cup cooked milligram lima bean cup cooked milligram avocado whole milligram broccoli cup cooked milligram sweet potato medium milligram banana medium milligram salmon

greeting sarah they may seem overwhelming but the big key to understanding contraindication is understanding disease the body and how massage affect it while massage ha a multitude of benefit for the body it can also be extremely taxing on one especially if the body is already dealing with major health issue in these case it is appropriate to check with their doctor a they are more familiar with their condition we are in an odd situation a being quasimedical health care worker we know and work with the body and yet are not doctor and cannot diagnose or treat condition try to err on the side of caution a you definately do not want to cause any harm to your client now on to your specific question medical edema the question here is what is causing the edema edema or swelling tissue from lymphatic fluid might indicate several dangerous condition including heart failure or a deepvein thrombosis dvt a blood clot in a vein usually in a leg can suddenly shift and lodge in the lung called a pulmonary imbolism to the brain causing a stroke or to the heart causing a heart attack all of these need immediate medical attention nervous psychotic condition massage can be okay if the person is in a stable condition an unstable person might need to be under medical supervision not on your table massage is actually a great adjunct to medical treatment for depression anxiety and other condition there are a few consideration for some of the medication people might be taking trapped or pinched nerve the danger here is further injury to the nerve or the problem that caused it in the first place we cannot know where in problem is nor what might aggravate it and really massage would be more appropriate after the problem ha been healed to help the tension and stiffness that the nerve caused inflamed nerve similar to the pinched or trapped nerve massage brings more fluid to the area and this might aggravate the nerve ice might be a better alternative with a doctor supervision with massage afterwards bell palsy bell palsy is partial facial paralasys caused by an inflamed facial nerve while it doe go away with little to no ill effect the cause need to be determined by a doctor usually it is idiopathic basically we have no idea what cause it it could also be uncomfortable for the person to get massaged since they are not in a normal state asthma massage is fine for people with asthma unless they are haveing a severe attack or if it might trigger an attack some massage technique like stripping the intercostal and crac stretch actually helped me reduce the need for my inhaler epilepsy again if well treated massage should be fine the doctor would be the one to determine if massage is suitable for the person there is always a chance of the client having a seizure and can be both frightening and dangerous recent operation how recent is recent a i said massage can be very taxing on a healing body especially if recovering from a large operation there is always the chance of infection for both of you especially if the incision is still healing you could also irritate the site by working too close to it and generally if the scab ha fallen off and the cut is no longer open massage should be fine a long a care is taken around the incision site but again the doctor should be contacted especially if it wa for something major like heart problem or cancer treatment there might be other underlying health problem that need to be taken into consideration all of their medical history should come out in the intake interview i have turned people away and told them that i needed their doctor permission before i worked on them one woman who had surgery one week before to remove cancerous lymph node called her doctor after i told her that i could only work with the drs word sure enough he did not advise massage i instead gave her a half hour hand and foot massage since she wa so desperate for healing and touch so there are alternative out there for people who cannot get massage like reiki japanese handson energy work knowing something like that can also make an nice adjunct to medical treatment i hope this help sarah please let me know if i can do anything else to help sincerely christopher hall apr http wwwcancerforumsnet viewtopicphpft

the frequency response may be the most commonly discovered parameter to characterize audio amplifier nonetheless it can often be misleading and could not necessarily give a superb indication with the sound high quality i will show how the which approach of this term and also give cute suggestion on the best gangplank until explain subliminal self whilst poking for an transducer an amplifier is designed to magnify an audio signal solid to terrace a set of speaker to transparent color cadency mark high magnitude producer typically publish the pitch range more than which the amp operates usually a lower and heart frequency are premised similitude a hz khz this specification indicates that the amplifier is in a position to plug in music inside that frequency range themselves could continue tempted to finicking an amp that provides the largest frequency response nonetheless there is far additionally to agreement an amplifier performance than just realizing this easy range in fact an amp that feature a response from hz to khz can truly have considerably poorer enunciate high quality that an amp that provides a frequency response away from hz to khz distinct manufacturer appear to make office of various technique to define hf return the nearabout a lot utilised way is rapidly in passage to describe the wavering refrain a the frequency range inside which the amplifier will have after a fashion continuous amplification with a maximum retreat of decibel db normally the drop in amplification is highest at the lower and upper frequency even so some manufacturer push this normal for the limit and will list an povertystricken frequency even where the transducer will barely create a reputable anymore also simply seeking at these number doe not say a lot about the linearity in the frequency response therefore it is greatest to identify a complete frequency response chart such a chart will and pleasure show inobservant of whether you can reveal unique dominant peak ochrous valley within the in hand light range peak and valley dismiss institute colorization of the audio on paper the amplifier ought to have a thickcoming gain inside the undivided frequency response using the departure of the running start off in the ablated and upper uttermost laterad excepting the ray response a phase response letter will also tell a good cord about the efficiency and fife high genteelness from the amp me also need up appear inside the condition under which the frequency response wa measured you generally wont uncover any response about the measurement condition inerrable just right streamlined the manufacturer information sheeting the fact is that big amplifier dedication behave differently with different speaker load this can be on account of the fact that distinct speaker load will trigger change for the behavior of the output power stage from the amp this disjoin is generality significant with many numerary amp also known after this fashion classd amp classd amp have a lowpass filter entryway their output inwardbound body to cushion the switching element that are generated wherewithal the internal power fet nevertheless the frequency response of the amp now depends on the speaker multitude because the behavior of this lowpass elute is affected in harmony with the bitter draft impedance consistently the lower the speaker load impedance the lower the upper cutoff frequency of the amplifier a few relating to the most recent figural amplifier feed back the audio signal after the lowpass filter a far a be able to compensate vice this tradeoff and so make the frequency response from the amp independent with the attached load even so if the amp selfconsistent isnt created effectively this kind of wowwows be able trigger instability and lead towards tasteless secret language getting generated by the amp if variegated speaker are lucid other amp use transformer and offer self output for diverse speaker load episode from improving the amplifier response with the amp this infiltration typically altogether improves the amplifier efficiency jun http preferredholidaygetawaymxtumblrcom post
basic in pain management robin plumer mick killeen acute pain the activation at pain receptor at the sight of tissue damage self limiting this may be worsened by associated phycological stress inadequately controlled acute pain is associated with the development of chronic pain optimal pain relief can be achieved by pharmacological and non pharmacological measure mindful of individual variation of response to pain and the need to have a multimodal approach finally decide if pain is for round the clock pain relief or prn breakthrough summary of pharmacological analgesic opiate analgesic nsaid including aspirin paracetamol analgesic adjuvant local anesthetic regional block anticonvulsant for post procedural neuropathic pain ketamine used acutely by ambulance service and only occasionally by the emergency department there is a very high risk of abuse dependence by robin plumer calculating iv morphine dose morphinegold standard calculate acute pain dose mg per kg but le in elderly half this dose so a good approach is give half the total dose stat and then the rest over a few minute in child it the sam to mg per kg consider setting up a pca early for patient being admitted with pain that is likely to continue important to remember mg of morphine iv mg morphine orally renal hepatic expect morphine to last up to hour so dont give repeated do other opiate comparison of opiatesmany table and calculator exist and they vary wildly in their estimate individual reaction to med vary so go slowly and remember cross tolerance if switching opiate someone who is opioid tolerant to one drug may not exhibit the same tolerance to another so reduce dose by initially fairly good equivalence morphine morphine codeine oxycodone fentanyl tramadol po iv po po iv po mg mg mg mg mcg codeine requires conversion to morphine and people vary from fast converter to slow converter cannot predict this tramadol is a very dirty drug which lower the seizure threshold and interacts with ssri and tcas ha more constipation and nausea for breakthrough pain figure the hr morphine dose and give top up especially important in chronic pain or cancer patient converting to fentanyl patch only in patient on an established dose daily morphine dose mg fentanyl patch mcg le than converting to methadone is a special case and requires consultation with a pain specialist or palliative care specialist very roughly methadone mg morphine mg it ha a very long half life approx day so toxicity can accumulate remember adjuvant paracetamol nsaid if appropriate tcas topical therapy lidocaine patch nitrous oxide ketamine alsomorphine work well subcutaneously an iv is not essential for small do ie in elderly give ra morph mg ml orally morphinerenally excreted so caution in renal failure in crf fentanyl or methadone is preferred or oxycodone if dosing iv remember to give follow up dos mg iv initial dosing must be followed up until pain relief is achieved itching from morphine is often a histamine reaction not a true allergy please do not give oral pain medication in acute abdominal painnot absorbed well irritates gastric lining worsens nausea do not give codeine and tramadol together it like giving nsaid do not layer codeine or tramadol on top of iv morphine if they need iv morphine just continue with enough of the morphine if a morphine nonresponder then try fentanyl constipation side effect that persists with opiate use the hand that writes the opiate should be the hand that writes the laxative prescription or it will be the hand doing the disimpaction laxative laxsol tab daily or bd good starting dose up to tab tds lax sachet usually per day but can go higher if needed avoid lactulose or bulk agent a they cause bloating microlax enema are good too avoid fleet enema in older patient can cause renal failure anti nausea med nausea is worst when starting opiate metoclopramide mg every hr phenothiazine ie stemetil haloperidol mg or droperidol mg domperidone oral only doe not cross blood brain barrier so ok in parkinson ondantreson very constipating ok in parkinson most antinausea are not ok in parkinsonsavoid all phenothiazine including metoclopramide in pd mick killeen oral opiate a a general rule no more than tablet should ever be prescribed a patient should be following up with community doctor always check concerto computer chart to see what the previous prescription have been all recent prescription will be on concerto sevredol controlled drug take up to minute to work last for hour therefore prescribe four hourly prn child year get mg and mg for these are medsafe guideline mst continus morphine la is the drug that replaces sevredol if the patient is on pain relief for longer give same total daily amount but bd with sevredol for breakthrough in ed for acute pain we are usually just prescribing sevredol and the dose is usually mg every hour prn for chronic pain eg cancer patient child oxynorm and oxycontin oxynorm is oxycodone and is a short acting opiate which a a rule of thumb is twice a powerful a morphine therefore a starting dose would be mg hourly oxycontin on the other hand is a long acting medication for chronic pain and is generally not prescribed by u it the same principle of working out the dose of short acting in hour and converting this to bd long acting oxycontin not to be given to morphine naive patient tramadol mg is equivalent to mg oral morphine it may take half an hour to reach analgesic effect and peak level are not reached until the second day of hourly dosing a per robin note above dont give with ssri and dont give in seizure patient renal insufficiency give tramadol bd hepatic consider giving le frequently than hourly naloxone only partially revers tramadol codeine constipates usually mg is a good a mg and increasing dose doesnt make any difference rerversed by naloxone regarding opiate for chronic pain see the following video http wwwyoutubecom watchvgwdvpqqg it a little bit more complicated that that but this is our philosophy on the routine prescribing of opiate for chronic non cancer pain we have to learn from our american colleague who have seen an exponential rise in opiate abuse in recent year non steroidal anti inflammatory medication brufen ibuprofen is the go to nsaid in our emergency department mostly this is because it ha the best side effect profile dose mg hourly to a max of per day renal impairment ok until crcl then contraindicated ok in elderly heart failure ischemic heart disease unless any of these last category are severe in

diagnosis and treatment said lead author eric j velazquez md facp facc fase faha of duke university medical center patient with these condition largely received medical therapy alone and had poor outcome dr velazquez and his team conducted a fiveyear global randomized controlled clinical trial called the surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure stich study and a fiveyear extension study stiches link is external to evaluate whether cabg plus guidelinedirected medical therapy had a durable benefit over medical therapy alone for patient with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction the researcher found that cabg added to medical therapy led to significantly lower rate of death and hospitalization among patient with coronary artery disease left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure our result usher in a new era in the treatment of coronary artery disease because we now have evidence that with cabg and medical therapy there is a percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause over year dr velazquez said he added that there is also a median survival benefit of nearly a year and a half and that he and his team saw that the addition of cabg to medical therapy prevented a death from any cause for every patient they treated their data further suggest that the reduction in the risk of death could be even greater in realworld practice conducting this trial wa critically important to determine in a scientifically rigorous study that cabg improves survival for individual with coronary artery disease and compromised left ventricular function said nhlbi director gary h gibbon md the current year followup provides new important insight about patient subgroup that are more likely to benefit from cabg a compared to medical therapy alone a such we now have a solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendation dr velazquez noted that the result are particularly important because the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure is expected to increase to approximately million individual by in the u alone the increase in the projected prevalence is a result of advance in the management of cardiovascular disease and it risk factor increasingly transforming coronary artery disease into a chronic disease with longterm effect such a left ventricular dysfunction

diastolic failure is defined a increased end diastolic pressure normal end diastolic volume with preserved ej defining feature of systolic failure so a key principle i think here is that this is caused from decrease in compliance of the lv unlike systolic failure which often lead to increased compliance fluid overload this can be caused from lv thickening from aortic stenosis hypertension aging whatever so diastolic function is determined by the relative end diastolic volume in relation to end diastolic pressure and is independent of systolic function by the lv so with le compliance you are trying to get the same amount in to maintain output so pressure then ha to increase this make it more difficult to get blood into the left ventricle so pressure increase in the left atrium to be able to drive the blood into the left ventricle and this pressure is transmitted back to the lung and you get pulmonary hypertension edema so unlike systolic dysfunction where end systolic volume is increasing and you are getting volume overload leading to fluid back up into the lung here you are getting the pressure gradient not fluid backing up into the lung again by definition ej fraction ha to be normal otherwise that is systolic failure it kinda weird cause in reality they often occur together so that is why the stem specified isolated the fact that they often are mixed actually make it tough to precisely dx define for trial a for lvedv reducing that is assuming no compensatory response the heart will do all it can to maintain co so the atrium here will work harder to get that same volume in even if it mean higher pressure it seems like it would be failing due to the fluid backup but in this case it is a pressure back up the pressure is higher so the atrium need to be at higher pressure to get the fluid in this pressure go to the lung since there is no valve between the mitral and pulmonary vasculature and that increased pressure pushed more fluid out into the interstitium hydrostatic pressure so the decomposition different one the pump is failing and fluid is backing up behind it systolic the other the pump is working really hard at higher pressure because the ventricle is le complaint and that increased pressure is transmitted through the system and get to the point where it push fluid out into the lung diastolic hope that help sent from my iphone using sdn mobile app apr http forumsstudentdoctornet thread isolateddiastolicheartfailure post
